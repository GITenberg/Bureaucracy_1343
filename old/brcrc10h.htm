 BUREAUCRACY</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h4>THE RABOURDIN HOUSEHOLD</h4>

<p>In Paris, where men of thought and study bear a certain
likeness to<br>
 one another, living as they do in a common centre, you must have
met<br>
 with several resembling Monsieur Rabourdin, whose acquaintance
we are<br>
 about to make at a moment when he is head of a bureau in one of
our<br>
 most important ministries. At this period he was forty years
old, with<br>
 gray hair of so pleasing a shade that women might at a pinch
fall in<br>
 love with it for it softened a somewhat melancholy countenance,
blue<br>
 eyes full of fire, a skin that was still fair, though rather
ruddy and<br>
 touched here and there with strong red marks; a forehead and
nose a la<br>
 Louis XV., a serious mouth, a tall figure, thin, or perhaps
wasted,<br>
 like that of a man just recovering from illness, and finally,
a<br>
 bearing that was midway between the indolence of a mere idler
and the<br>
 thoughtfulness of a busy man. If this portrait serves to depict
his<br>
 character, a sketch of this man's dress will bring it still
further<br>
 into relief. Rabourdin wore habitually a blue surcoat, a white
cravat,<br>
 a waistcoat crossed a la Robespierre, black trousers without
straps,<br>
 gray silk stockings and low shoes. Well-shaved, and with his
stomach<br>
 warmed by a cup of coffee, he left home at eight in the morning
with<br>
 the regularity of clock-work, always passing along the same
streets on<br>
 his way to the ministry: so neat was he, so formal, so starched
that<br>
 he might have been taken for an Englishman on the road to his
embassy.</p>

<p><br>
 From these general signs you will readily discern a family
man,<br>
 harassed by vexations in his own household, worried by
annoyances at<br>
 the ministry, yet philosopher enough to take life as he found
it; an<br>
 honest man, loving his country and serving it, not concealing
from<br>
 himself the obstacles in the way of those who seek to do
right;<br>
 prudent, because he knew men; exquisitely courteous with women,
of<br>
 whom he asked nothing,--a man full of acquirements, affable with
his<br>
 inferiors, holding his equals at great distance, and dignified
towards<br>
 his superiors. At the epoch of which we write, you would have
noticed<br>
 in him the coldly resigned air of one who has buried the
illusions of<br>
 his youth and renounced every secret ambition; you would
have<br>
 recognized a discouraged, but not disgusted man, one who still
clings<br>
 to his first projects,--more perhaps to employ his faculties
than in<br>
 the hope of a doubtful success. He was not decorated with any
order,<br>
 and always accused himself of weakness for having worn that of
the<br>
 Fleur-de-lis in the early days of the Restoration.</p>

<p>The life of this man was marked by certain mysterious
peculiarities.<br>
 He had never known his father; his mother, a woman to whom
luxury was<br>
 everything, always elegantly dressed, always on pleasure bent,
whose<br>
 beauty seemed to him miraculous and whom he very seldom saw,
left him<br>
 little at her death; but she had given him that too common
and<br>
 incomplete education which produces so much ambition and so
little<br>
 ability. A few days before his mother's death, when he was
just<br>
 sixteen, he left the Lycee Napoleon to enter as supernumerary
a<br>
 government office, where an unknown protector had provided him
with a<br>
 place. At twenty-two years of age Rabourdin became
under-head-clerk;<br>
 at twenty-five, head-clerk, or, as it was termed, head of the
bureau.<br>
 From that day the hand that assisted the young man to start in
life<br>
 was never felt again in his career, except as to a single<br>
 circumstance; it led him, poor and friendless, to the house of
a<br>
 Monsieur Leprince, formerly an auctioneer, a widower said to
be<br>
 extremely rich, and father of an only daughter. Xavier Rabourdin
fell<br>
 desperately in love with Mademoiselle Celestine Leprince,
then<br>
 seventeen years of age, who had all the matrimonial claims of a
dowry<br>
 of two hundred thousand francs. Carefully educated by an
artistic<br>
 mother, who transmitted her own talents to her daughter, this
young<br>
 lady was fitted to attract distinguished men. Tall, handsome,
and<br>
 finely-formed, she was a good musician, drew and painted,
spoke<br>
 several languages, and even knew something of science,--a
dangerous<br>
 advantage, which requires a woman to avoid carefully all
appearance of<br>
 pedantry. Blinded by mistaken tenderness, the mother gave the
daughter<br>
 false ideas as to her probable future; to the maternal eyes a
duke or<br>
 an ambassador, a marshal of France or a minister of State, could
alone<br>
 give her Celestine her due place in society. The young lady
had,<br>
 moreover, the manners, language, and habits of the great world.
Her<br>
 dress was richer and more elegant than was suitable for an
unmarried<br>
 girl; a husband could give her nothing more than she now had,
except<br>
 happiness. Besides all such indulgences, the foolish spoiling of
the<br>
 mother, who died a year after the girl's marriage, made a
husband's<br>
 task all the more difficult. What coolness and composure of mind
were<br>
 needed to rule such a woman! Commonplace suitors held back in
fear.<br>
 Xavier Rabourdin, without parents and without fortune other than
his<br>
 situation under government, was proposed to Celestine by her
father.<br>
 She resisted for a long time; not that she had any personal
objection<br>
 to her suitor, who was young, handsome, and much in love, but
she<br>
 shrank from the plain name of Madame Rabourdin. Monsieur
Leprince<br>
 assured his daughter that Xavier was of the stock that statesmen
came<br>
 of. Celestine answered that a man named Rabourdin would never
be<br>
 anything under the government of the Bourbons, etc. Forced back
to his<br>
 intrenchments, the father made the serious mistake of telling
his<br>
 daughter that her future husband was certain of becoming
Rabourdin "de<br>
 something or other" before he reached the age of admission to
the<br>
 Chamber. Xavier was soon to be appointed Master of petitions,
and<br>
 general-secretary at his ministry. From these lower steps of
the<br>
 ladder the young man would certainly rise to the higher ranks of
the<br>
 administration, possessed of a fortune and a name bequeathed to
him in<br>
 a certain will of which he, Monsieur Leprince, was cognizant. On
this<br>
 the marriage took place.</p>

<p>Rabourdin and his wife believed in the mysterious protector to
whom<br>
 the auctioneer alluded. Led away by such hopes and by the
natural<br>
 extravagance of happy love, Monsieur and Madame Rabourdin spent
nearly<br>
 one hundred thousand francs of their capital in the first five
years<br>
 of married life. By the end of this time Celestine, alarmed at
the<br>
 non-advancement of her husband, insisted on investing the
remaining<br>
 hundred thousand francs of her dowry in landed property,
which<br>
 returned only a slender income; but her future inheritance from
her<br>
 father would amply repay all present privations with perfect
comfort<br>
 and ease of life. When the worthy auctioneer saw his
son-in-law<br>
 disappointed of the hopes they had placed on the nameless
protector,<br>
 he tried, for the sake of his daughter, to repair the secret
loss by<br>
 risking part of his fortune in a speculation which had
favourable<br>
 chances of success. But the poor man became involved in one of
the<br>
 liquidations of the house of Nucingen, and died of grief,
leaving<br>
 nothing behind him but a dozen fine pictures which adorned
his<br>
 daughter's salon, and a few old-fashioned pieces of furniture,
which<br>
 she put in the garret.</p>

<p>Eight years of fruitless expectation made Madame Rabourdin at
last<br>
 understand that the paternal protector of her husband must have
died,<br>
 and that his will, if it ever existed, was lost or destroyed.
Two<br>
 years before her father's death the place of chief of division,
which<br>
 became vacant, was given, over her husband's head, to a
certain<br>
 Monsieur de la Billardiere, related to a deputy of the Right who
was<br>
 made minister in 1823. It was enough to drive Rabourdin out of
the<br>
 service; but how could he give up his salary of eight thousand
francs<br>
 and perquisites, when they constituted three fourths of his
income and<br>
 his household was accustomed to spend them? Besides, if he
had<br>
 patience for a few more years he would then be entitled to a
pension.<br>
 What a fall was this for a woman whose high expectations at
the<br>
 opening of her life were more or less warranted, and one who
was<br>
 admitted on all sides to be a superior woman.</p>

<p>Madame Rabourdin had justified the expectations formed of
Mademoiselle<br>
 Leprince; she possessed the elements of that apparent
superiority<br>
 which pleases the world; her liberal education enabled her to
speak to<br>
 every one in his or her own language; her talents were real;
she<br>
 showed an independent and elevated mind; her conversation
charmed as<br>
 much by its variety and ease as by the oddness and originality
of her<br>
 ideas. Such qualities, useful and appropriate in a sovereign or
an<br>
 ambassadress, were of little service to a household compelled to
jog<br>
 in the common round. Those who have the gift of speaking well
desire<br>
 an audience; they like to talk, even if they sometimes weary
others.<br>
 To satisfy the requirements of her mind Madame Rabourdin took a
weekly<br>
 reception-day and went a great deal into society to obtain
the<br>
 consideration her self-love was accustomed to enjoy. Those who
know<br>
 Parisian life will readily understand how a woman of her
temperament<br>
 suffered, and was martyrized at heart by the scantiness of
her<br>
 pecuniary means. No matter what foolish declarations people make
about<br>
 money, they one and all, if they live in Paris, must grovel
before<br>
 accounts, do homage to figures, and kiss the forked hoof of the
golden<br>
 calf. What a problem was hers! twelve thousand francs a year to
defray<br>
 the costs of a household consisting of father, mother, two
children, a<br>
 chambermaid and cook, living on the second floor of a house in
the rue<br>
 Duphot, in an apartment costing two thousand francs a year.
Deduct the<br>
 dress and the carriage of Madame before you estimate the
gross<br>
 expenses of the family, for dress precedes everything; then see
what<br>
 remains for the education of the children (a girl of eight and a
boy<br>
 of nine, whose maintenance must cost at least two thousand
francs<br>
 besides) and you will find that Madame Rabourdin could barely
afford<br>
 to give her husband thirty francs a month. That is the position
of<br>
 half the husbands in Paris, under penalty of being thought
monsters.</p>

<p>Thus it was that this woman who believed herself destined to
shine in<br>
 the world was condemned to use her mind and her faculties in a
sordid<br>
 struggle, fighting hand to hand with an account-book.
Already,<br>
 terrible sacrifice of pride! she had dismissed her man-servant,
not<br>
 long after the death of her father. Most women grow weary of
this<br>
 daily struggle; they complain but they usually end by giving up
to<br>
 fate and taking what comes to them; Celestine's ambition, far
from<br>
 lessening, only increased through difficulties, and led her,
when she<br>
 found she could not conquer them, to sweep them aside. To her
mind<br>
 this complicated tangle of the affairs of life was a Gordian
knot<br>
 impossible to untie and which genius ought to cut. Far from
accepting<br>
 the pettiness of middle-class existence, she was angry at the
delay<br>
 which kept the great things of life from her grasp,--blaming
fate as<br>
 deceptive. Celestine sincerely believed herself a superior
woman.<br>
 Perhaps she was right; perhaps she would have been great under
great<br>
 circumstances; perhaps she was not in her right place. Let us
remember<br>
 there are as many varieties of woman as there are of man, all of
which<br>
 society fashions to meet its needs. Now in the social order, as
in<br>
 Nature's order, there are more young shoots than there are
trees, more<br>
 spawn than full-grown fish, and many great capacities
(Athanase<br>
 Granson, for instance) which die withered for want of moisture,
like<br>
 seeds on stony ground. There are, unquestionably, household
women,<br>
 accomplished women, ornamental women, women who are exclusively
wives,<br>
 or mothers, or sweethearts, women purely spiritual or purely
material;<br>
 just as there are soldiers, artists, artisans, mathematicians,
poets,<br>
 merchants, men who understand money, or agriculture, or
government,<br>
 and nothing else. Besides all this, the eccentricity of events
leads<br>
 to endless cross-purposes; many are called and few are chosen is
the<br>
 law of earth as of heaven. Madame Rabourdin conceived herself
fully<br>
 capable of directing a statesman, inspiring an artist, helping
an<br>
 inventor and pushing his interests, or of devoting her powers to
the<br>
 financial politics of a Nucingen, and playing a brilliant part
in the<br>
 great world. Perhaps she was only endeavouring to excuse to her
own<br>
 mind a hatred for the laundry lists and the duty of overlooking
the<br>
 housekeeping bills, together with the petty economies and cares
of a<br>
 small establishment. She was superior only in those things where
it<br>
 gave her pleasure to be so. Feeling as keenly as she did the
thorns of<br>
 a position which can only be likened to that of Saint-Laurence
on his<br>
 grid-iron, is it any wonder that she sometimes cried out? So, in
her<br>
 paroxysms of thwarted ambition, in the moments when her wounded
vanity<br>
 gave her terrible shooting pains, Celestine turned upon
Xavier<br>
 Rabourdin. Was it not her husband's duty to give her a
suitable<br>
 position in the world? If she were a man she would have had the
energy<br>
 to make a rapid fortune for the sake of rendering an adored
wife<br>
 happy! She reproached him for being too honest a man. In the
mouth of<br>
 some women this accusation is a charge of imbecility. She
sketched out<br>
 for him certain brilliant plans in which she took no account of
the<br>
 hindrances imposed by men and things; then, like all women under
the<br>
 influence of vehement feeling, she became in thought as
Machiavellian<br>
 as Gondreville, and more unprincipled than Maxime de Trailles.
At such<br>
 times Celestine's mind took a wide range, and she imagined
herself at<br>
 the summit of her ideas.</p>

<p>When these fine visions first began Rabourdin, who saw the
practical<br>
 side, was cool. Celestine, much grieved, thought her husband
narrow-<br>
 minded, timid, unsympathetic; and she acquired, insensibly, a
wholly<br>
 false opinion of the companion of her life. In the first place,
she<br>
 often extinguished him by the brilliancy of her arguments. Her
ideas<br>
 came to her in flashes, and she sometimes stopped him short when
he<br>
 began an explanation, because she did not choose to lose the
slightest<br>
 sparkle of her own mind. From the earliest days of their
marriage<br>
 Celestine, feeling herself beloved and admired by her husband,
treated<br>
 him without ceremony; she put herself above conjugal laws and
the<br>
 rules of private courtesy by expecting love to pardon all her
little<br>
 wrong-doings; and, as she never in any way corrected herself,
she was<br>
 always in the ascendant. In such a situation the man holds to
the wife<br>
 very much the position of a child to a teacher when the latter
cannot<br>
 or will not recognize that the mind he has ruled in childhood
is<br>
 becoming mature. Like Madame de Stael, who exclaimed in a room
full of<br>
 people, addressing, as we may say, a greater man than herself,
"Do you<br>
 know you have really said something very profound!" Madame
Rabourdin<br>
 said of her husband: "He certainly has a good deal of sense at
times."<br>
 Her disparaging opinion of him gradually appeared in her
behavior<br>
 through almost imperceptible motions. Her attitude and
manners<br>
 expressed a want of respect. Without being aware of it she
injured her<br>
 husband in the eyes of others; for in all countries society,
before<br>
 making up its mind about a man, listens for what his wife thinks
of<br>
 him, and obtains from her what the Genevese term
"pre-advice."</p>

<p>When Rabourdin became aware of the mistakes which love had led
him to<br>
 commit it was too late,--the groove had been cut; he suffered
and was<br>
 silent. Like other men in whom sentiments and ideas are of
equal<br>
 strength, whose souls are noble and their brains well balanced,
he was<br>
 the defender of his wife before the tribunal of his own
judgment; he<br>
 told himself that nature doomed her to a disappointed life
through his<br>
 fault; HIS; she was like a thoroughbred English horse, a
racer<br>
 harnessed to a cart full of stones; she it was who suffered; and
he<br>
 blamed himself. His wife, by dint of constant repetition,
had<br>
 inoculated him with her own belief in herself. Ideas are
contagious in<br>
 a household; the ninth thermidor, like so many other
portentous<br>
 events, was the result of female influence. Thus, goaded by<br>
 Celestine's ambition, Rabourdin had long considered the means
of<br>
 satisfying it, though he hid his hopes, so as to spare her
the<br>
 tortures of uncertainty. The man was firmly resolved to make his
way<br>
 in the administration by bringing a strong light to bear upon
it. He<br>
 intended to bring about one of those revolutions which send a
man to<br>
 the head of either one party or another in society; but
being<br>
 incapable of so doing in his own interests, he merely pondered
useful<br>
 thoughts and dreamed of triumphs won for his country by noble
means.<br>
 His ideas were both generous and ambitious; few officials have
not<br>
 conceived the like; but among officials as among artists there
are<br>
 more miscarriages than births; which is tantamount to Buffon's
saying<br>
 that "Genius is patience."</p>

<p>Placed in a position where he could study French
administration and<br>
 observe its mechanism, Rabourdin worked in the circle where
his<br>
 thought revolved, which, we may remark parenthetically, is the
secret<br>
 of much human accomplishment; and his labor culminated finally
in the<br>
 invention of a new system for the Civil Service of government.
Knowing<br>
 the people with whom he had to do, he maintained the machine as
it<br>
 then worked, so it still works and will continue to work;
for<br>
 everybody fears to remodel it, though no one, according to
Rabourdin,<br>
 ought to be unwilling to simplify it. In his opinion, the
problem to<br>
 be resolved lay in a better use of the same forces. His plan, in
its<br>
 simplest form, was to revise taxation and lower it in a way
that<br>
 should not diminish the revenues of the State, and to obtain,
from a<br>
 budget equal to the budgets which now excite such rabid
discussion,<br>
 results that should be two-fold greater than the present
results. Long<br>
 practical experience had taught Rabourdin that perfection is
brought<br>
 about in all things by changes in the direction of simplicity.
To<br>
 economize is to simplify. To simplify means to suppress
unnecessary<br>
 machinery; removals naturally follow. His system, therefore,
depended<br>
 on the weeding out of officials and the establishment of a new
order<br>
 of administrative offices. No doubt the hatred which all
reformers<br>
 incur takes its rise here. Removals required by this
perfecting<br>
 process, always ill-understood, threaten the well-being of those
on<br>
 whom a change in their condition is thus forced. What
rendered<br>
 Rabourdin really great was that he was able to restrain the
enthusiasm<br>
 that possesses all reformers, and to patiently seek out a
slow<br>
 evolving medium for all changes so as to avoid shocks, leaving
time<br>
 and experience to prove the excellence of each reform. The
grandeur of<br>
 the result anticipated might make us doubt its possibility if we
lose<br>
 sight of this essential point in our rapid analysis of his
system. It<br>
 is, therefore, not unimportant to show through his
self-communings,<br>
 however incomplete they might be, the point of view from which
he<br>
 looked at the administrative horizon. This tale, which is
evolved from<br>
 the very heart of the Civil Service, may also serve to show some
of<br>
 the evils of our present social customs.</p>

<p><br>
 Xavier Rabourdin, deeply impressed by the trials and poverty
which he<br>
 witnessed in the lives of the government clerks, endeavored
to<br>
 ascertain the cause of their growing deterioration. He found it
in<br>
 those petty partial revolutions, the eddies, as it were, of the
storm<br>
 of 1789, which the historians of great social movements neglect
to<br>
 inquire into, although as a matter of fact it is they which have
made<br>
 our manners and customs what they are now.</p>

<p>Formerly, under the monarchy, the bureaucratic armies did not
exist.<br>
 The clerks, few in number, were under the orders of a prime
minister<br>
 who communicated with the sovereign; thus they directly served
the<br>
 king. The superiors of these zealous servants were simply called
head-<br>
 clerks. In those branches of administration which the king did
not<br>
 himself direct, such for instance as the "fermes" (the public
domains<br>
 throughout the country on which a revenue was levied), the
clerks were<br>
 to their superior what the clerks of a business-house are to
their<br>
 employer; they learned a science which would one day advance
them to<br>
 prosperity. Thus, all points of the circumference were fastened
to the<br>
 centre and derived their life from it. The result was devotion
and<br>
 confidence. Since 1789 the State, call it the Nation if you
like, has<br>
 replaced the sovereign. Instead of looking directly to the
chief<br>
 magistrate of this nation, the clerks have become, in spite of
our<br>
 fine patriotic ideas, the subsidiaries of the government;
their<br>
 superiors are blown about by the winds of a power called
"the<br>
 administration," and do not know from day to day where they may
be on<br>
 the morrow. As the routine of public business must go on, a
certain<br>
 number of indispensable clerks are kept in their places, though
they<br>
 hold these places on sufferance, anxious as they are to retain
them.<br>
 Bureaucracy, a gigantic power set in motion by dwarfs, was
generated<br>
 in this way. Though Napoleon, by subordinating all things and
all men<br>
 to his will, retarded for a time the influence of bureaucracy
(that<br>
 ponderous curtain hung between the service to be done and the
man who<br>
 orders it), it was permanently organized under the
constitutional<br>
 government, which was, inevitably, the friend of all
mediocrities, the<br>
 lover of authentic documents and accounts, and as meddlesome as
an old<br>
 tradeswoman. Delighted to see the various ministers
constantly<br>
 struggling against the four hundred petty minds of the Elected
of the<br>
 Chamber, with their ten or a dozen ambitious and dishonest
leaders,<br>
 the Civil Service officials hastened to make themselves
essential to<br>
 the warfare by adding their quota of assistance under the form
of<br>
 written action; they created a power of inertia and named it
"Report."<br>
 Let us explain the Report.</p>

<p>When the kings of France took to themselves ministers, which
first<br>
 happened under Louis XV., they made them render reports on
all<br>
 important questions, instead of holding, as formerly, grand
councils<br>
 of state with the nobles. Under the constitutional government,
the<br>
 ministers of the various departments were insensibly led by
their<br>
 bureaus to imitate this practice of kings. Their time being
taken up<br>
 in defending themselves before the two Chambers and the court,
they<br>
 let themselves be guided by the leading-strings of the Report.
Nothing<br>
 important was ever brought before the government that a minister
did<br>
 not say, even when the case was urgent, "I have called for a
report."<br>
 The Report thus became, both as to the matter concerned and for
the<br>
 minister himself, the same as a report to the Chamber of
Deputies on a<br>
 question of laws,--namely, a disquisition in which the reasons
for and<br>
 against are stated with more or less partiality. No real result
is<br>
 attained; the minister, like the Chamber, is fully as well
prepared<br>
 before as after the report is rendered. A determination, in
whatever<br>
 matter, is reached in an instant. Do what we will, the moment
comes<br>
 when the decision must be made. The greater the array of reasons
for<br>
 and against, the less sound will be the judgment. The finest
things of<br>
 which France can boast have been accomplished without reports
and<br>
 where decisions were prompt and spontaneous. The dominant law of
a<br>
 statesman is to apply precise formula to all cases, after the
manner<br>
 of judges and physicians.</p>

<p>Rabourdin, who said to himself: "A minister should have
decision,<br>
 should know public affairs, and direct their course," saw
"Report"<br>
 rampant throughout France, from the colonel to the marshal, from
the<br>
 commissary of police to the king, from the prefects to the
ministers<br>
 of state, from the Chamber to the courts. After 1818 everything
was<br>
 discussed, compared, and weighed, either in speech or writing;
public<br>
 business took a literary form. France went to ruin in spite of
this<br>
 array of documents; dissertations stood in place of action; a
million<br>
 of reports were written every year; bureaucracy was
enthroned!<br>
 Records, statistics, documents, failing which France would have
been<br>
 ruined, circumlocution, without which there could be no
advance,<br>
 increased, multiplied, and grew majestic. From that day
forth<br>
 bureaucracy used to its own profit the mistrust that stands
between<br>
 receipts and expenditures; it degraded the administration for
the<br>
 benefit of the administrators; in short, it spun those
lilliputian<br>
 threads which have chained France to Parisian
centralization,--as if<br>
 from 1500 to 1800 France had undertaken nothing for want of
thirty<br>
 thousand government clerks! In fastening upon public offices,
like a<br>
 mistletoe on a pear-tree, these officials indemnified
themselves<br>
 amply, and in the following manner.</p>

<p>The ministers, compelled to obey the princes or the Chambers
who<br>
 impose upon them the distribution of the public moneys, and
forced to<br>
 retain the workers in office, proceeded to diminish salaries
and<br>
 increase the number of those workers, thinking that if more
persons<br>
 were employed by government the stronger the government would
be. And<br>
 yet the contrary law is an axiom written on the universe; there
is no<br>
 vigor except where there are few active principles. Events
proved in<br>
 July, 1830, the error of the materialism of the Restoration. To
plant<br>
 a government in the hearts of a nation it is necessary to
bind<br>
 INTERESTS to it, not MEN. The government-clerks being led to
detest<br>
 the administrations which lessened both their salaries and
their<br>
 importance, treated them as a courtesan treats an aged lover,
and gave<br>
 them mere work for money; a state of things which would have
seemed as<br>
 intolerable to the administration as to the clerks, had the
two<br>
 parties dared to feel each other's pulse, or had the higher
salaries<br>
 not succeeded in stifling the voices of the lower. Thus wholly
and<br>
 solely occupied in retaining his place, drawing his pay, and
securing<br>
 his pension, the government official thought everything
permissible<br>
 that conduced to these results. This state of things led to
servility<br>
 on the part of the clerks and to endless intrigues within the
various<br>
 departments, where the humbler clerks struggled vainly
against<br>
 degenerate members of the aristocracy, who sought positions in
the<br>
 government bureaus for their ruined sons.</p>

<p>Superior men could scarcely bring themselves to tread these
tortuous<br>
 ways, to stoop, to cringe, and creep through the mire of
these<br>
 cloacas, where the presence of a fine mind only alarmed the
other<br>
 denizens. The ambitious man of genius grows old in obtaining
his<br>
 triple crown; he does not follow in the steps of Sixtus the
Fifth<br>
 merely to become head of a bureau. No one comes or stays in
the<br>
 government offices but idlers, incapables, or fools. Thus
the<br>
 mediocrity of French administration has slowly come about.<br>
 Bureaucracy, made up entirely of petty minds, stands as an
obstacle to<br>
 the prosperity of the nation; delays for seven years, by its<br>
 machinery, the project of a canal which would have stimulated
the<br>
 production of a province; is afraid of everything, prolongs<br>
 procrastination, and perpetuates the abuses which in turn
perpetuate<br>
 and consolidate itself. Bureaucracy holds all things and the<br>
 administration itself in leading strings; it stifles men of
talent who<br>
 are bold enough to be independent of it or to enlighten it on
its own<br>
 follies. About the time of which we write the pension list had
just<br>
 been issued, and on it Rabourdin saw the name of an underling
in<br>
 office rated for a larger sum than the old colonels, maimed
and<br>
 wounded for their country. In that fact lies the whole history
of<br>
 bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Another evil, brought about by modern customs, which Rabourdin
counted<br>
 among the causes of this secret demoralization, was the fact
that<br>
 there is no real subordination in the administration in
Paris;<br>
 complete equality reigns between the head of an important
division and<br>
 the humblest copying-clerk; one is as powerful as the other in
an<br>
 arena outside of which each lords it in his own way.
Education,<br>
 equally distributed through the masses, brings the son of a
porter<br>
 into a government office to decide the fate of some man of merit
or<br>
 some landed proprietor whose door-bell his father may have
answered.<br>
 The last comer is therefore on equal terms with the oldest
veteran in<br>
 the service. A wealthy supernumerary splashes his superior as
he<br>
 drives his tilbury to Longchamps and points with his whip to the
poor<br>
 father of a family, remarking to the pretty woman at his side,
"That's<br>
 my chief." The Liberals call this state of things Progress;
Rabourdin<br>
 thought it Anarchy at the heart of power. He saw how it resulted
in<br>
 restless intrigues, like those of a harem between eunuchs and
women<br>
 and imbecile sultans, or the petty troubles of nuns full of
underhand<br>
 vexations, or college tyrannies, or diplomatic manoeuvrings fit
to<br>
 terrify an ambassador, all put in motion to obtain a fee or
an<br>
 increase in salary; it was like the hopping of fleas harnessed
to<br>
 pasteboard cars, the spitefulness of slaves, often visited on
the<br>
 minister himself. With all this were the really useful men,
the<br>
 workers, victims of such parasites; men sincerely devoted to
their<br>
 country, who stood vigorously out from the background of the
other<br>
 incapables, yet who were often forced to succumb through
unworthy<br>
 trickery.</p>

<p>All the higher offices were gained through parliamentary
influence,<br>
 royalty had nothing to do now with them, and the subordinate
clerks<br>
 became, after a time, merely the running-gear of the machine;
the most<br>
 important considerations with them being to keep the wheels
well<br>
 greased. This fatal conviction entering some of the best
minds<br>
 smothered many statements conscientiously written on the secret
evils<br>
 of the national government; lowered the courage of many hearts,
and<br>
 corrupted sterling honesty, weary of injustice and won to
indifference<br>
 by deteriorating annoyances. A clerk in the employ of the
Rothchilds<br>
 corresponds with all England; another, in a government office,
may<br>
 communicate with all the prefects; but where the one learns the
way to<br>
 make his fortune, the other loses time and health and life to
no<br>
 avail. An undermining evil lies here. Certainly a nation does
not seem<br>
 threatened with immediate dissolution because an able clerk is
sent<br>
 away and a middling sort of man replaces him. Unfortunately for
the<br>
 welfare of nations individual men never seem essential to
their<br>
 existence. But in the long run when the belittling process is
fully<br>
 carried out nations will disappear. Every one who seeks
instruction on<br>
 this point can look at Venice, Madrid, Amsterdam, Stockholm,
Rome; all<br>
 places which were formerly resplendent with mighty powers and
are now<br>
 destroyed by the infiltrating littleness which gradually
attained the<br>
 highest eminence. When the day of struggle came, all was found
rotten,<br>
 the State succumbed to a weak attack. To worship the fool
who<br>
 succeeds, and not to grieve over the fall of an able man is the
result<br>
 of our melancholy education, of our manners and customs which
drive<br>
 men of intellect into disgust, and genius to despair.</p>

<p>What a difficult undertaking is the rehabilitation of the
Civil<br>
 Service while the liberal cries aloud in his newspapers that
the<br>
 salaries of clerks are a standing theft, calls the items of the
budget<br>
 a cluster of leeches, and every year demands why the nation
should be<br>
 saddled with a thousand millions of taxes. In Monsieur
Rabourdin's<br>
 eyes the clerk in relation to the budget was very much what
the<br>
 gambler is to the game; that which he wins he puts back again.
All<br>
 remuneration implies something furnished. To pay a man a
thousand<br>
 francs a year and demand his whole time was surely to organize
theft<br>
 and poverty. A galley-slave costs nearly as much, and does less.
But<br>
 to expect a man whom the State remunerated with twelve thousand
francs<br>
 a year to devote himself to his country was a profitable
contract for<br>
 both sides, fit to allure all capacities.</p>

<p>These reflections had led Rabourdin to desire the recasting of
the<br>
 clerical official staff. To employ fewer man, to double or
treble<br>
 salaries, and do away with pensions, to choose only young clerks
(as<br>
 did Napoleon, Louis XIV., Richelieu, and Ximenes), but to keep
them<br>
 long and train them for the higher offices and greatest honors,
these<br>
 were the chief features of a reform which if carried out would
be as<br>
 beneficial to the State as to the clerks themselves. It is
difficult<br>
 to recount in detail, chapter by chapter, a plan which embraced
the<br>
 whole budget and continued down through the minutest details
of<br>
 administration in order to keep the whole synthetical; but
perhaps a<br>
 slight sketch of the principal reforms will suffice for those
who<br>
 understand such matters, as well as for those who are wholly
ignorant<br>
 of the administrative system. Though the historian's position
is<br>
 rather hazardous in reproducing a plan which may be thought
the<br>
 politics of a chimney-corner, it is, nevertheless, necessary to
sketch<br>
 it so as to explain the author of it by his own work. Were the
recital<br>
 of his efforts to be omitted, the reader would not believe
the<br>
 narrator's word if he merely declared the talent and the courage
of<br>
 this official.</p>

<p>Rabourdin's plan divided the government into three ministries,
or<br>
 departments. He thought that if the France of former days
possessed<br>
 brains strong enough to comprehend in one system both foreign
and<br>
 domestic affairs, the France of to-day was not likely to be
without<br>
 its Mazarin, its Suger, its Sully, its de Choiseul, or its
Colbert to<br>
 direct even vast administrative departments. Besides,
constitutionally<br>
 speaking, three ministries will agree better than seven; and, in
the<br>
 restricted number there is less chance for mistaken choice;
moreover,<br>
 it might be that the kingdom would some day escape from
those<br>
 perpetual ministerial oscillations which interfered with all
plans of<br>
 foreign policy and prevented all ameliorations of home rule.
In<br>
 Austria, where many diverse united nations present so many
conflicting<br>
 interests to be conciliated and carried forward under one crown,
two<br>
 statesmen alone bear the burden of public affairs and are
not<br>
 overwhelmed by it. Was France less prolific of political
capacities<br>
 than Germany? The rather silly game of what are called
"constitutional<br>
 institutions" carried beyond bounds has ended, as everybody
knows, in<br>
 requiring a great many offices to satisfy the multifarious
ambition of<br>
 the middle classes. It seemed to Rabourdin, in the first
place,<br>
 natural to unite the ministry of war with the ministry of the
navy. To<br>
 his thinking the navy was one of the current expenses of the
war<br>
 department, like the artillery, cavalry, infantry, and
commissariat.<br>
 Surely it was an absurdity to give separate administrations
to<br>
 admirals and marshals when both were employed to one end,
namely, the<br>
 defense of the nation, the overthrow of an enemy, and the
security of<br>
 the national possessions. The ministry of the interior ought in
like<br>
 manner to combine the departments of commerce, police, and
finances,<br>
 or it belied its own name. To the ministry of foreign affairs
belonged<br>
 the administration of justice, the household of the king, and
all that<br>
 concerned arts, sciences, and belles lettres. All patronage
ought to<br>
 flow directly from the sovereign. Such ministries necessitated
the<br>
 supremacy of a council. Each required the work of two
hundred<br>
 officials, and no more, in its central administration offices,
where<br>
 Rabourdin proposed that they should live, as in former days
under the<br>
 monarchy. Taking the sum of twelve thousand francs a year for
each<br>
 official as an average, he estimated seven millions as the cost
of the<br>
 whole body of such officials, which actually stood at twenty in
the<br>
 budget.</p>

<p>By thus reducing the ministers to three heads he
suppressed<br>
 departments which had come to be useless, together with the
enormous<br>
 costs of their maintenance in Paris. He proved that an
arrondissement<br>
 could be managed by ten men; a prefecture by a dozen at the
most;<br>
 which reduced the entire civil service force throughout France
to five<br>
 thousand men, exclusive of the departments of war and justice.
Under<br>
 this plan the clerks of the court were charged with the system
of<br>
 loans, and the ministry of the interior with that of
registration and<br>
 the management of domains. Thus Rabourdin united in one centre
all<br>
 divisions that were allied in nature. The mortgage system,<br>
 inheritance, and registration did not pass outside of their own
sphere<br>
 of action and only required three additional clerks in the
justice<br>
 courts and three in the royal courts. The steady application of
this<br>
 principle brought Rabourdin to reforms in the finance system.
He<br>
 merged the collection of revenue into one channel, taxing
consumption<br>
 in bulk instead of taxing property. According to his ideas,<br>
 consumption was the sole thing properly taxable in times of
peace.<br>
 Land-taxes should always be held in reserve in case of war; for
then<br>
 only could the State justly demand sacrifices from the soil,
which was<br>
 in danger; but in times of peace it was a serious political
fault to<br>
 burden it beyond a certain limit; otherwise it could never be
depended<br>
 on in great emergencies. Thus a loan should be put on the market
when<br>
 the country was tranquil, for at such times it could be placed
at par,<br>
 instead of at fifty per cent loss as in bad times; in war times
resort<br>
 should be had to a land-tax.</p>

<p>"The invasion of 1814 and 1815," Rabourdin would say to his
friends,<br>
 "founded in France and practically explained an institution
which<br>
 neither Law nor Napoleon had been able to establish,--I mean
Credit."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Xavier considered the true principles of this
admirable<br>
 machine of civil service very little understood at the period
when he<br>
 began his labor of reform in 1820. His scheme levied a toll on
the<br>
 consumption by means of direct taxation and suppressed the
whole<br>
 machinery of indirect taxation. The levying of the taxes was<br>
 simplified by a single classification of a great number of
articles.<br>
 This did away with the more harassing customs at the gates of
the<br>
 cities, and obtained the largest revenues from the remainder,
by<br>
 lessening the enormous expense of collecting them. To lighten
the<br>
 burden of taxation is not, in matters of finance, to diminish
the<br>
 taxes, but to assess them better; if lightened, you increase
the<br>
 volume of business by giving it freer play; the individual pays
less<br>
 and the State receives more. This reform, which may seem
immense,<br>
 rests on very simple machinery. Rabourdin regarded the tax on
personal<br>
 property as the most trustworthy representative of general<br>
 consumption. Individual fortunes are usually revealed in France
by<br>
 rentals, by the number of servants, horses, carriages, and
luxuries,<br>
 the costs of which are all to the interest of the public
treasury.<br>
 Houses and what they contain vary comparatively but little, and
are<br>
 not liable to disappear. After pointing out the means of making
a tax-<br>
 list on personal property which should be more impartial than
the<br>
 existing list, Rabourdin assessed the sums to be brought into
the<br>
 treasury by indirect taxation as so much per cent on each
individual<br>
 share. A tax is a levy of money on things or persons under
disguises<br>
 that are more or less specious. These disguises, excellent when
the<br>
 object is to extort money, become ridiculous in the present day,
when<br>
 the class on which the taxes weigh the heaviest knows why the
State<br>
 imposes them and by what machinery they are given back. In fact
the<br>
 budget is not a strong-box to hold what is put into it, but
a<br>
 watering-pot; the more it takes in and the more it pours out
the<br>
 better for the prosperity of the country. Therefore, supposing
there<br>
 are six millions of tax-payers in easy circumstances (Rabourdin
proved<br>
 their existence, including the rich) is it not better to make
them pay<br>
 a duty on the consumption of wine, which would not be more
offensive<br>
 than that on doors and windows and would return a hundred
millions,<br>
 rather than harass them by taxing the thing itself. By this
system of<br>
 taxation, each individual tax-payer pays less in reality, while
the<br>
 State receives more, and consumers profit by a vast reduction in
the<br>
 price of things which the State releases from its perpetual
and<br>
 harassing interference. Rabourdin's scheme retained a tax on
the<br>
 cultivation of vineyards, so as to protect that industry from
the too<br>
 great abundance of its own products. Then, to reach the
consumption of<br>
 the poorer tax-payers, the licences of retail dealers were
taxed<br>
 according to the population of the neighborhoods in which they
lived.</p>

<p>In this way, the State would receive without cost or
vexatious<br>
 hindrances an enormous revenue under three forms; namely, a duty
on<br>
 wine, on the cultivation of vineyards, and on licenses, where
now an<br>
 irritating array of taxes existed as a burden on itself and
its<br>
 officials. Taxation was thus imposed upon the rich without<br>
 overburdening the poor. To give another example. Suppose a
share<br>
 assessed to each person of one or two francs for the consumption
of<br>
 salt and you obtain ten or a dozen millions; the modern
"gabelle"<br>
 disappears, the poor breathe freer, agriculture is relieved, the
State<br>
 receives as much, and no tax-payer complains. All persons,
whether<br>
 they belong to the industrial classes or to the capitalists,
will see<br>
 at once the benefits of a tax so assessed when they discover
how<br>
 commerce increases, and life is ameliorated in the country
districts.<br>
 In short, the State will see from year to year the number of her
well-<br>
 to-do tax-payers increasing. By doing away with the machinery
of<br>
 indirect taxation, which is very costly (a State, as it were,
within a<br>
 State), both the public finances and the individual tax-payer
are<br>
 greatly benefited, not to speak of the saving in costs of
collecting.</p>

<p>The whole subject is indeed less a question of finance than a
question<br>
 of government. The State should possess nothing of its own,
neither<br>
 forests, nor mines, nor public works. That it should be the
owner of<br>
 domains was, in Rabourdin's opinion, an administrative
contradiction.<br>
 The State cannot turn its possessions to profit and it deprives
itself<br>
 of taxes; it thus loses two forms of production. As to the<br>
 manufactories of the government, they are just as unreasonable
in the<br>
 sphere of industry. The State obtains products at a higher cost
than<br>
 those of commerce, produces them more slowly, and loses its tax
upon<br>
 the industry, the maintenance of which it, in turn, reduces. Can
it be<br>
 thought a proper method of governing a country to manufacture
instead<br>
 of promoting manufactures? to possess property instead of
creating<br>
 more possessions and more diverse ones? In Rabourdin's system
the<br>
 State exacted no money security; he allowed only mortgage
securities;<br>
 and for this reason: Either the State holds the security in
specie,<br>
 and that embarrasses business and the movement of money; or it
invests<br>
 it at a higher rate than the State itself pays, and that is
a<br>
 contemptible robbery; or else it loses on the transaction, and
that is<br>
 folly; moreover, if it is obliged at any time to dispose of a
mass of<br>
 these securities it gives rises in certain cases to terrible<br>
 bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The territorial tax did not entirely disappear in Rabourdin's
plan,--<br>
 he kept a minute portion of it as a point of departure in case
of war;<br>
 but the productions of the soil were freed, and industry,
finding raw<br>
 material at a low price, could compete with foreign nations
without<br>
 the deceptive help of customs. The rich carried on the
administration<br>
 of the provinces without compensation except that of receiving
a<br>
 peerage under certain conditions. Magistrates, learned
bodies,<br>
 officers of the lower grades found their services honorably
rewarded;<br>
 no man employed by the government failed to obtain great
consideration<br>
 through the value and extent of his labors and the excellence of
his<br>
 salary; every one was able to provide for his own future and
France<br>
 was delivered from the cancer of pensions. As a result
Rabourdin's<br>
 scheme exhibited only seven hundred millions of expenditures
and<br>
 twelve hundred millions of receipts. A saving of five hundred
millions<br>
 annually had far more virtue than the accumulation of a sinking
fund<br>
 whose dangers were plainly to be seen. In that fund the
State,<br>
 according to Rabourdin, became a stockholder, just as it
persisted in<br>
 being a land-holder and a manufacturer. To bring about these
reforms<br>
 without too roughly jarring the existing state of things or
incurring<br>
 a Saint-Bartholomew of clerks, Rabourdin considered that an
evolution<br>
 of twenty years would be required.</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts maturing in Rabourdin's mind ever since
his<br>
 promised place had been given to Monsieur de la Billardiere, a
man of<br>
 sheer incapacity. This plan, so vast apparently yet so simple in
point<br>
 of fact, which did away with so many large staffs and so many
little<br>
 offices all equally useless, required for its presentation to
the<br>
 public mind close calculations, precise statistics, and
self-evident<br>
 proof. Rabourdin had long studied the budget under its
double-aspect<br>
 of ways and means and of expenditure. Many a night he had lain
awake<br>
 unknown to his wife. But so far he had only dared to conceive
the plan<br>
 and fit it prospectively to the administrative skeleton; all of
which<br>
 counted for nothing,--he must gain the ear of a minister capable
of<br>
 appreciating his ideas. Rabourdin's success depended on the
tranquil<br>
 condition of political affairs, which up to this time were
still<br>
 unsettled. He had not considered the government as permanently
secure<br>
 until three hundred deputies at least had the courage to form
a<br>
 compact majority systematically ministerial. An administration
founded<br>
 on that basis had come into power since Rabourdin had finished
his<br>
 elaborate plan. At this time the luxury of peace under the
Bourbons<br>
 had eclipsed the warlike luxury of the days when France shone
like a<br>
 vast encampment, prodigal and magnificent because it was
victorious.<br>
 After the Spanish campaign, the administration seemed to enter
upon an<br>
 era of tranquillity in which some good might be accomplished;
and<br>
 three months before the opening of our story a new reign had
begun<br>
 without any apparent opposition; for the liberalism of the Left
had<br>
 welcomed Charles X. with as much enthusiasm as the Right. Even
clear-<br>
 sighted and suspicious persons were misled. The moment
seemed<br>
 propitious for Rabourdin. What could better conduce to the
stability<br>
 of the government than to propose and carry through a reform
whose<br>
 beneficial results were to be so vast?</p>

<p><br>
 Never had Rabourdin seemed so anxious and preoccupied as he now
did in<br>
 the mornings as he walked from his house to the ministry, or at
half-<br>
 past four in the afternoon, when he returned. Madame Rabourdin,
on her<br>
 part, disconsolate over her wasted life, weary of secretly
working to<br>
 obtain a few luxuries of dress, never appeared so bitterly<br>
 discontented as now; but, like any wife who is really attached
to her<br>
 husband, she considered it unworthy of a superior woman to
condescend<br>
 to the shameful devices by which the wives of some officials eke
out<br>
 the insufficiency of their husband's salary. This feeling made
her<br>
 refuse all intercourse with Madame Colleville, then very
intimate with<br>
 Francois Keller, whose parties eclipsed those of the rue
Duphot.<br>
 Nevertheless, she mistook the quietude of the political thinker
and<br>
 the preoccupation of the intrepid worker for the apathetic
torpor of<br>
 an official broken down by the dulness of routine, vanquished by
that<br>
 most hateful of all miseries, the mediocrity that simply earns
a<br>
 living; and she groaned at being married to a man without
energy.</p>

<p>Thus it was that about this period in their lives she resolved
to take<br>
 the making of her husband's fortune on herself; to thrust him at
any<br>
 cost into a higher sphere, and to hide from him the secret
springs of<br>
 her machinations. She carried into all her plans the
independence of<br>
 ideas which characterized her, and was proud to think that she
could<br>
 rise above other women by sharing none of their petty prejudices
and<br>
 by keeping herself untrammelled by the restraints which
society<br>
 imposes. In her anger she resolved to fight fools with their
own<br>
 weapons, and to make herself a fool if need be. She saw things
coming<br>
 to a crisis. The time was favorable. Monsieur de la
Billardiere,<br>
 attacked by a dangerous illness, was likely to die in a few
days. If<br>
 Rabourdin succeeded him, his talents (for Celestine did
vouchsafe him<br>
 an administrative gift) would be so thoroughly appreciated that
the<br>
 office of Master of petitions, formerly promised, would now be
given<br>
 to him; she fancied she saw him the king's commissioner,
presenting<br>
 bills to the Chambers and defending them; then indeed she could
help<br>
 him; she would even be, if needful, his secretary; she would sit
up<br>
 all night to do the work! All this to drive in the Bois in a
pretty<br>
 carriage, to equal Madame Delphine de Nucingen, to raise her
salon to<br>
 the level of Madame Colleville's, to be invited to the great<br>
 ministerial solemnities, to win listeners and make them talk of
her as<br>
 "Madame Rabourdin DE something or other" (she had not yet
determined<br>
 on the estate), just as they did of Madame Firmiani, Madame
d'Espard,<br>
 Madame d'Aiglemont, Madame de Carigliano, and thus efface
forever the<br>
 odious name of Rabourdin.</p>

<p>These secret schemes brought some changes into the household.
Madame<br>
 Rabourdin began to walk with a firm step in the path of DEBT.
She set<br>
 up a manservant, and put him in livery of brown cloth with red
pipins,<br>
 she renewed parts of her furniture, hung new papers on the
walls,<br>
 adorned her salon with plants and flowers, always fresh, and
crowded<br>
 it with knick-knacks that were then in vogue; then she, who had
always<br>
 shown scruples as to her personal expenses, did not hesitate to
put<br>
 her dress in keeping with the rank to which she aspired, the
profits<br>
 of which were discounted in several of the shops where she
equipped<br>
 herself for war. To make her "Wednesdays" fashionable she gave
a<br>
 dinner on Fridays, the guests being expected to pay their return
visit<br>
 and take a cup of tea on the following Wednesday. She chose her
guests<br>
 cleverly among influential deputies or other persons of note
who,<br>
 sooner or later, might advance her interests. In short, she
gathered<br>
 an agreeable and befitting circle about her. People amused
themselves<br>
 at her house; they said so at least, which is quite enough to
attract<br>
 society in Paris. Rabourdin was so absorbed in completing his
great<br>
 and serious work that he took no notice of the sudden
reappearance of<br>
 luxury in the bosom of his family.</p>

<p>Thus the wife and the husband were besieging the same
fortress,<br>
 working on parallel lines, but without each other's
knowledge.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>MONSIEUR DES LUPEAULX</h4>

<p>At the ministry to which Rabourdin belonged there flourished,
as<br>
 general-secretary, a certain Monsieur Clement Chardin des
Lupeaulx,<br>
 one of those men whom the tide of political events sends to
the<br>
 surface for a few years, then engulfs on a stormy night, but
whom we<br>
 find again on a distant shore, tossed up like the carcass of a
wrecked<br>
 ship which still seems to have life in her. We ask ourselves if
that<br>
 derelict could ever have held goodly merchandise or served a
high<br>
 emprize, co-operated in some defence, held up the trappings of
a<br>
 throne, or borne away the corpse of a monarchy. At this
particular<br>
 time Clement des Lupeaulx (the "Lupeaulx" absorbed the
"Chardin") had<br>
 reached his culminating period. In the most illustrious lives as
in<br>
 the most obscure, in animals as in secretary-generals, there is
a<br>
 zenith and there is a nadir, a period when the fur is
magnificent, the<br>
 fortune dazzling. In the nomenclature which we derive from
fabulists,<br>
 des Lupeaulx belonged to the species Bertrand, and was always
in<br>
 search of Ratons. As he is one of the principal actors in this
drama<br>
 he deserves a description, all the more precise because the
revolution<br>
 of July has suppressed his office, eminently useful as it was,
to a<br>
 constitutional ministry.</p>

<p><br>
 Moralists usually employ their weapons against obstructive<br>
 administrations. In their eyes, crime belongs to the assizes or
the<br>
 police-courts; but the socially refined evils escape their ken;
the<br>
 adroitness that triumphs under shield of the Code is above them
or<br>
 beneath them; they have neither eye-glass nor telescope; they
want<br>
 good stout horrors easily visible. With their eyes fixed on
the<br>
 carnivora, they pay no attention to the reptiles; happily,
they<br>
 abandon to the writers of comedy the shading and colorings of
a<br>
 Chardin des Lupeaulx. Vain and egotistical, supple and
proud,<br>
 libertine and gourmand, grasping from the pressure of debt,
discreet<br>
 as a tomb out of which nought issues to contradict the
epitaph<br>
 intended for the passer's eye, bold and fearless when
soliciting,<br>
 good-natured and witty in all acceptations of the word, a
timely<br>
 jester, full of tact, knowing how to compromise others by a
glance or<br>
 a nudge, shrinking from no mudhole, but gracefully leaping
it,<br>
 intrepid Voltairean, yet punctual at mass if a fashionable
company<br>
 could be met in Saint Thomas Aquinas,--such a man as this
secretary-<br>
 general resembled, in one way or another, all the mediocrities
who<br>
 form the kernel of the political world. Knowing in the science
of<br>
 human nature, he assumed the character of a listener, and none
was<br>
 ever more attentive. Not to awaken suspicion he was flattering
ad<br>
 nauseum, insinuating as a perfume, and cajoling as a woman.</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx was just forty years old. His youth had long been
a<br>
 vexation to him, for he felt that the making of his career
depended on<br>
 his becoming a deputy. How had he reached his present position?
may be<br>
 asked. By very simple means. He began by taking charge of
certain<br>
 delicate missions which can be given neither to a man who
respects<br>
 himself nor to a man who does not respect himself, but are
confided to<br>
 grave and enigmatic individuals who can be acknowledged or
disavowed<br>
 at will. His business was that of being always compromised; but
his<br>
 fortunes were pushed as much by defeat as by success. He
well<br>
 understood that under the Restoration, a period of continual<br>
 compromises between men, between things, between accomplished
facts<br>
 and other facts looking on the horizon, it was all-important for
the<br>
 ruling powers to have a household drudge. Observe in a family
some old<br>
 charwoman who can make beds, sweep the floors, carry away the
dirty<br>
 linen, who knows where the silver is kept, how the creditors
should be<br>
 pacified, what persons should be let in and who must be kept out
of<br>
 the house, and such a creature, even if she has all the vices,
and is<br>
 dirty, decrepit, and toothless, or puts into the lottery and
steals<br>
 thirty sous a day for her stake, and you will find the masters
like<br>
 her from habit, talk and consult in her hearing upon even
critical<br>
 matters; she comes and goes, suggests resources, gets on the
scent of<br>
 secrets, brings the rouge or the shawl at the right moment,
lets<br>
 herself be scolded and pushed downstairs, and the next
morning<br>
 reappears smiling with an excellent bouillon. No matter how high
a<br>
 statesman may stand, he is certain to have some household
drudge,<br>
 before whom he is weak, undecided, disputations with fate,
self-<br>
 questioning, self-answering, and buckling for the fight. Such
a<br>
 familiar is like the soft wood of savages, which, when rubbed
against<br>
 the hard wood, strikes fire. Sometimes great geniuses
illumine<br>
 themselves in this way. Napoleon lived with Berthier, Richelieu
with<br>
 Pere Joseph; des Lupeaulx was the familiar of everybody. He
continued<br>
 friends with fallen ministers and made himself their
intermediary with<br>
 their successors, diffusing thus the perfume of the last
flattery and<br>
 the first compliment. He well understood how to arrange all the
little<br>
 matters which a statesman has no leisure to attend to. He
saw<br>
 necessities as they arose; he obeyed well; he could gloss a base
act<br>
 with a jest and get the whole value of it; and he chose for
the<br>
 services he thus rendered those that the recipients were not
likely to<br>
 forget.</p>

<p>Thus, when it was necessary to cross the ditch between the
Empire and<br>
 the Restoration, at a time when every one was looking about
for<br>
 planks, and the curs of the Empire were howling their devotion
right<br>
 and left, des Lupeaulx borrowed large sums from the usurers
and<br>
 crossed the frontier. Risking all to win all, he bought up
Louis<br>
 XVIII.'s most pressing debts, and was the first to settle nearly
three<br>
 million of them at twenty per cent--for he was lucky enough to
be<br>
 backed by Gobseck in 1814 and 1815. It is true that Messrs.
Gobseck,<br>
 Werdet, and Gigonnet swallowed the profits, but des Lupeaulx
had<br>
 agreed that they should have them; he was not playing for a
stake; he<br>
 challenged the bank, as it were, knowing very well that the king
was<br>
 not a man to forget this debt of honor. Des Lupeaulx was not
mistaken;<br>
 he was appointed Master of petitions, Knight of the order of
Saint<br>
 Louis, and officer of the Legion of honor. Once on the ladder
of<br>
 political success, his clever mind looked about for the means
to<br>
 maintain his foothold; for in the fortified city into which he
had<br>
 wormed himself, generals do not long keep useless mouths. So to
his<br>
 general trade of household drudge and go-between he added that
of<br>
 gratuitous consultation on the secret maladies of power.</p>

<p>After discovering in the so-called superior men of the
Restoration<br>
 their utter inferiority in comparison with the events which
had<br>
 brought them to the front, he overcame their political
mediocrity by<br>
 putting into their mouths, at a crisis, the word of command for
which<br>
 men of real talent were listening. It must not be thought that
this<br>
 word was the outcome of his own mind. Were it so, des Lupeaulx
would<br>
 have been a man of genius, whereas he was only a man of talent.
He<br>
 went everywhere, collected opinions, sounded consciences, and
caught<br>
 all the tones they gave out. He gathered knowledge like a true
and<br>
 indefatigable political bee. This walking Bayle dictionary did
not<br>
 act, however, like that famous lexicon; he did not report all
opinions<br>
 without drawing his own conclusions; he had the talent of a fly
which<br>
 drops plumb upon the best bit of meat in the middle of a
kitchen. In<br>
 this way he came to be regarded as an indispensable helper
to<br>
 statesmen. A belief in his capacity had taken such deep root in
all<br>
 minds that the more ambitious public men felt it was necessary
to<br>
 compromise des Lupeaulx in some way to prevent his rising
higher; they<br>
 made up to him for his subordinate public position by their
secret<br>
 confidence.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, feeling that such men were dependent on him,
this<br>
 gleaner of ideas exacted certain dues. He received a salary on
the<br>
 staff of the National Guard, where he held a sinecure which was
paid<br>
 for by the city of Paris; he was government commissioner to a
secret<br>
 society; and filled a position of superintendence in the
royal<br>
 household. His two official posts which appeared on the budget
were<br>
 those of secretary-general to his ministry and Master of
petitions.<br>
 What he now wanted was to be made commander of the Legion of
honor,<br>
 gentleman of the bed-chamber, count, and deputy. To be elected
deputy<br>
 it was necessary to pay taxes to the amount of a thousand
francs; and<br>
 the miserable homestead of the des Lupeaulx was rated at only
five<br>
 hundred. Where could he get money to build a mansion and
surround it<br>
 with sufficient domain to throw dust in the eyes of a
constituency?<br>
 Though he dined out every day, and was lodged for the last nine
years<br>
 at the cost of the State, and driven about in the minister's
equipage,<br>
 des Lupeaulx possessed absolutely nothing, at the time when our
tale<br>
 opens, but thirty thousand francs of debt--undisputed property.
A<br>
 marriage might float him and pump the waters of debt out of his
bark;<br>
 but a good marriage depended on his advancement, and his
advancement<br>
 required that he should be a deputy. Searching about him for the
means<br>
 of breaking through this vicious circle, he could think of
nothing<br>
 better than some immense service to render or some delicate
intrigue<br>
 to carry through for persons in power. Alas! conspiracies were
out of<br>
 date; the Bourbons were apparently on good terms with all
parties;<br>
 and, unfortunately, for the last few years the government had
been so<br>
 thoroughly held up to the light of day by the silly discussions
of the<br>
 Left, whose aim seemed to be to make government of any kind
impossible<br>
 in France, that no good strokes of business could be made. The
last<br>
 were tried in Spain, and what an outcry that excited!</p>

<p>In addition to all this, des Lupeaulx complicated matters by
believing<br>
 in the friendship of his minister, to whom he had the imprudence
to<br>
 express the wish to sit on the ministerial benches. The
minister<br>
 guessed at the real meaning of the desire, which simply was that
des<br>
 Lupeaulx wanted to strengthen a precarious position, so that he
might<br>
 throw off all dependence on his chief. The harrier turned
against the<br>
 huntsman; the minister gave him cuts with the whip and
caresses,<br>
 alternately, and set up rivals to him. But des Lupeaulx behaved
like<br>
 an adroit courtier with all competitors; he laid traps into
which they<br>
 fell, and then he did prompt justice upon them. The more he
felt<br>
 himself in danger the more anxious he became for an
irremovable<br>
 position; yet he was compelled to play low; one moment's
indiscretion,<br>
 and he might lose everything. A pen-stroke might demolish his
civilian<br>
 epaulets, his place at court, his sinecure, his two offices and
their<br>
 advantages; in all, six salaries retained under fire of the
law<br>
 against pluralists. Sometimes he threatened his minister as a
mistress<br>
 threatens her lover; telling him he was about to marry a rich
widow.<br>
 At such times the minister petted and cajoled des Lupeaulx.
After one<br>
 of these reconciliations he received the formal promise of a
place in<br>
 the Academy of Belles-lettres on the first vacancy. "It would
pay," he<br>
 said, "the keep of a horse." His position, so far as it went,
was a<br>
 good one, and Clement Chardin des Lupeaulx flourished in it like
a<br>
 tree planted in good soil. He could satisfy his vices, his
caprices,<br>
 his virtues and his defects.</p>

<p>The following were the toils of his life. He was obliged to
choose,<br>
 among five or six daily invitations, the house where he could be
sure<br>
 of the best dinner. Every morning he went to his minister's
morning<br>
 reception to amuse that official and his wife, and to pet
their<br>
 children. Then he worked an hour or two; that is to say, he lay
back<br>
 in a comfortable chair and read the newspapers, dictated the
meaning<br>
 of a letter, received visitors when the minister was not
present,<br>
 explained the work in a general way, caught or shed a few drops
of the<br>
 holy-water of the court, looked over the petitions with an
eyeglass,<br>
 or wrote his name on the margin,--a signature which meant "I
think it<br>
 absurd; do what you like about it." Every body knew that when
des<br>
 Lupeaulx was interested in any person or in any thing he
attended to<br>
 the matter personally. He allowed the head-clerks to
converse<br>
 privately about affairs of delicacy, but he listened to their
gossip.<br>
 From time to time he went to the Tuileries to get his cue. And
he<br>
 always waited for the minister's return from the Chamber, if
in<br>
 session, to hear from him what intrigue or manoeuvre he was to
set<br>
 about. This official sybarite dressed, dined, and visited a
dozen or<br>
 fifteen salons between eight at night and three in the morning.
At the<br>
 opera he talked with journalists, for he stood high in their
favor; a<br>
 perpetual exchange of little services went on between them; he
poured<br>
 into their ears his misleading news and swallowed theirs; he
prevented<br>
 them from attacking this or that minister on such or such a
matter, on<br>
 the plea that it would cause real pain to their wives or
their<br>
 mistresses.</p>

<p>"Say that his bill is worth nothing, and prove it if you can,
but do<br>
 not say that Mariette danced badly. The devil! haven't we all
played<br>
 our little plays; and which of us knows what will become of him
in<br>
 times like these? You may be minister yourself to-morrow, you
who are<br>
 spicing the cakes of the 'Constitutionel' to-day."</p>

<p>Sometimes, in return, he helped editors, or got rid of
obstacles to<br>
 the performances of some play; gave gratuities and good dinners
at the<br>
 right moment, or promised his services to bring some affair to a
happy<br>
 conclusion. Moreover, he really liked literature and the arts;
he<br>
 collected autographs, obtained splendid albums gratis, and
possessed<br>
 sketches, engravings, and pictures. He did a great deal of good
to<br>
 artists by simply not injuring them and by furthering their
wishes on<br>
 certain occasions when their self-love wanted some rather
costly<br>
 gratification. Consequently, he was much liked in the world of
actors<br>
 and actresses, journalists and artists. For one thing, they had
the<br>
 same vices and the same indolence as himself. Men who could all
say<br>
 such witty things in their cups or in company with a danseuse,
how<br>
 could they help being friends? If des Lupeaulx had not been a
general-<br>
 secretary he would certainly have been a journalist. Thus, in
that<br>
 fifteen years' struggle in which the harlequin sabre of epigram
opened<br>
 a breach by which insurrection entered the citadel, des Lupeaulx
never<br>
 received so much as a scratch.</p>

<p>As the young fry of clerks looked at this man playing bowls in
the<br>
 gardens of the ministry with the minister's children, they
cracked<br>
 their brains to guess the secret of his influence and the nature
of<br>
 his services; while, on the other hand, the aristocrats in all
the<br>
 various ministries looked upon him as a dangerous
Mephistopheles,<br>
 courted him, and gave him back with usury the flatteries he
bestowed<br>
 in the higher sphere. As difficult to decipher as a
hieroglyphic<br>
 inscription to the clerks, the vocation of the secretary and
his<br>
 usefulness were as plain as the rule of three to the
self-interested.<br>
 This lesser Prince de Wagram of the administration, to whom the
duty<br>
 of gathering opinions and ideas and making verbal reports
thereon was<br>
 entrusted, knew all the secrets of parliamentary politics;
dragged in<br>
 the lukewarm, fetched, carried, and buried propositions, said
the Yes<br>
 and the No that the ministers dared not say for themselves.
Compelled<br>
 to receive the first fire and the first blows of despair and
wrath, he<br>
 laughed or bemoaned himself with the minister, as the case might
be.<br>
 Mysterious link by which many interests were in some way
connected<br>
 with the Tuileries, and safe as a confessor, he sometimes
knew<br>
 everything and sometimes nothing; and, in addition to all
these<br>
 functions came that of saying for the minister those things that
a<br>
 minister cannot say for himself. In short, with his
political<br>
 Hephaestion the minister might dare to be himself; to take off
his wig<br>
 and his false teeth, lay aside his scruples, put on his
slippers,<br>
 unbutton his conscience, and give way to his trickery. However,
it was<br>
 not all a bed of roses for des Lupeaulx; he flattered and
advised his<br>
 master, forced to flatter in order to advise, to advise
while<br>
 flattering, and disguise the advice under the flattery. All<br>
 politicians who follow this trade have bilious faces; and
their<br>
 constant habit of giving affirmative nods acquiescing in what is
said<br>
 to them, or seeming to do so, gives a certain peculiar turn to
their<br>
 heads. They agree indifferently with whatever is said before
them.<br>
 Their talk is full of "buts," "notwithstandings," "for myself
I<br>
 should," "were I in your place" (they often say "in your
place"),--<br>
 phrases, however, which pave the way to opposition.</p>

<p>In person, Clement des Lupeaulx had the remains of a handsome
man;<br>
 five feet six inches tall, tolerably stout, complexion flushed
with<br>
 good living, powdered head, delicate spectacles, and a worn-out
air;<br>
 the natural skin blond, as shown by the hand, puffy like that of
an<br>
 old woman, rather too square, and with short nails--the hand of
a<br>
 satrap. His foot was elegant. After five o'clock in the
afternoon des<br>
 Lupeaulx was always to be seen in open-worked silk stockings,
low<br>
 shoes, black trousers, cashmere waistcoat, cambric
handkerchief<br>
 (without perfume), gold chain, blue coat of the shade called
"king's<br>
 blue," with brass buttons and a string of orders. In the morning
he<br>
 wore creaking boots and gray trousers, and the short close
surtout<br>
 coat of the politician. His general appearance early in the day
was<br>
 that of a sharp lawyer rather than that of a ministerial
officer. Eyes<br>
 glazed by the constant use of spectacles made him plainer than
he<br>
 really was, if by chance he took those appendages off. To real
judges<br>
 of character, as well as to upright men who are at ease only
with<br>
 honest natures, des Lupeaulx was intolerable. To them, his
gracious<br>
 manners only draped his lies; his amiable protestations and
hackneyed<br>
 courtesies, new to the foolish and ignorant, too plainly showed
their<br>
 texture to an observing mind. Such minds considered him a
rotten<br>
 plank, on which no foot should trust itself.</p>

<p>No sooner had the beautiful Madame Rabourdin decided to
interfere in<br>
 her husband's administrative advancement than she fathomed
Clement des<br>
 Lupeaulx's true character, and studied him thoughtfully to
discover<br>
 whether in this thin strip of deal there were ligneous fibres
strong<br>
 enough to let her lightly trip across it from the bureau to
the<br>
 department, from a salary of eight thousand a year to twelve
thousand.<br>
 The clever woman believed she could play her own game with
this<br>
 political roue; and Monsieur des Lupeaulx was partly the cause
of the<br>
 unusual expenditures which now began and were continued in
the<br>
 Rabourdin household.</p>

<p>The rue Duphot, built up under the Empire, is remarkable for
several<br>
 houses with handsome exteriors, the apartments of which are
skilfully<br>
 laid out. That of the Rabourdins was particularly well
arranged,--a<br>
 domestic advantage which has much to do with the nobleness of
private<br>
 lives. A pretty and rather wide antechamber, lighted from
the<br>
 courtyard, led to the grand salon, the windows of which looked
on the<br>
 street. To the right of the salon were Rabourdin's study and
bedroom,<br>
 and behind them the dining-room, which was entered from the<br>
 antechamber; to the left was Madame's bedroom and dressing-room,
and<br>
 behind them her daughter's little bedroom. On reception days the
door<br>
 of Rabourdin's study and that of his wife's bedroom were thrown
open.<br>
 The rooms were thus spacious enough to contain a select
company,<br>
 without the absurdity which attends many middle-class
entertainments,<br>
 where unusual preparations are made at the expense of the
daily<br>
 comfort, and consequently give the effect of exceptional effort.
The<br>
 salon had lately been rehung in gold-colored silk with
carmelite<br>
 touches. Madame's bedroom was draped in a fabric of true blue
and<br>
 furnished in a rococo manner. Rabourdin's study had inherited
the late<br>
 hangings of the salon, carefully cleaned, and was adorned by the
fine<br>
 pictures once belonging to Monsieur Leprince. The daughter of
the late<br>
 auctioneer had utilized in her dining-room certain exquisite
Turkish<br>
 rugs which her father had bought at a bargain; panelling them on
the<br>
 walls in ebony, the cost of which has since become exorbitant.
Elegant<br>
 buffets made by Boulle, also purchased by the auctioneer,
furnished<br>
 the sides of the room, at the end of which sparkled the
brass<br>
 arabesques inlaid in tortoise-shell of the first tall clock
that<br>
 reappeared in the nineteenth century to claim honor for the<br>
 masterpieces of the seventeenth. Flowers perfumed these rooms so
full<br>
 of good taste and of exquisite things, where each detail was a
work of<br>
 art well placed and well surrounded, and where Madame
Rabourdin,<br>
 dressed with that natural simplicity which artists alone attain,
gave<br>
 the impression of a woman accustomed to such elegancies, though
she<br>
 never spoke of them, but allowed the charms of her mind to
complete<br>
 the effect produced upon her guests by these delightful
surroundings.<br>
 Thanks to her father, Celestine was able to make society talk of
her<br>
 as soon as the rococo became fashionable.</p>

<p>Accustomed as des Lupeaulx was to false as well as real
magnificence<br>
 in all their stages, he was, nevertheless, surprised at
Madame<br>
 Rabourdin's home. The charm it exercised over this Parisian
Asmodeus<br>
 can be explained by a comparison. A traveller wearied with the
rich<br>
 aspects of Italy, Brazil, or India, returns to his own land and
finds<br>
 on his way a delightful little lake, like the Lac d'Orta at the
foot<br>
 of Monte Rosa, with an island resting on the calm waters,
bewitchingly<br>
 simple; a scene of nature and yet adorned; solitary, but
well<br>
 surrounded with choice plantations and foliage and statues of
fine<br>
 effect. Beyond lies a vista of shores both wild and
cultivated;<br>
 tumultuous grandeur towers above, but in itself all proportions
are<br>
 human. The world that the traveller has lately viewed is here
in<br>
 miniature, modest and pure; his soul, refreshed, bids him remain
where<br>
 a charm of melody and poesy surrounds him with harmony and
awakens<br>
 ideas within his mind. Such a scene represents both life and
a<br>
 monastery.</p>

<p>A few days earlier the beautiful Madame Firmiani, one of the
charming<br>
 women of the faubourg Saint-Germain who visited and liked
Madame<br>
 Rabourdin, had said to des Lupeaulx (invited expressly to hear
this<br>
 remark), "Why do you not call on Madame --?" with a motion
towards<br>
 Celestine; "she gives delightful parties, and her dinners, above
all,<br>
 are--better than mine."</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx allowed himself to be drawn into an engagement by
the<br>
 handsome Madame Rabourdin, who, for the first time, turned her
eyes on<br>
 him as she spoke. He had, accordingly, gone to the rue Duphot,
and<br>
 that tells the tale. Woman has but one trick, cries Figaro, but
that's<br>
 infallible. After dining once at the house of this
unimportant<br>
 official, des Lupeaulx made up his mind to dine there often.
Thanks to<br>
 the perfectly proper and becoming advances of the beautiful
woman,<br>
 whom her rival, Madame Colleville, called the Celimene of the
rue<br>
 Duphot, he had dined there every Friday for the last month,
and<br>
 returned of his own accord for a cup of tea on Wednesdays.</p>

<p>Within a few days Madame Rabourdin, having watched him
narrowly and<br>
 knowingly, believed she had found on the secretarial plank a
spot<br>
 where she might safely set her foot. She was no longer doubtful
of<br>
 success. Her inward joy can be realized only in the families
of<br>
 government officials where for three or four years prosperity
has been<br>
 counted on through some appointment, long expected and long
sought.<br>
 How many troubles are to be allayed! how many entreaties and
pledges<br>
 given to the ministerial divinities! how many visits of
self-interest<br>
 paid! At last, thanks to her boldness, Madame Rabourdin heard
the hour<br>
 strike when she was to have twenty thousand francs a year
instead of<br>
 eight thousand.</p>

<p>"And I shall have managed well," she said to herself. "I have
had to<br>
 make a little outlay; but these are times when hidden merit
is<br>
 overlooked, whereas if a man keeps himself well in sight before
the<br>
 world, cultivates social relations and extends them, he
succeeds.<br>
 After all, ministers and their friends interest themselves only
in the<br>
 people they see; but Rabourdin knows nothing of the world! If I
had<br>
 not cajoled those three deputies they might have wanted La<br>
 Billardiere's place themselves; whereas, now that I have invited
them<br>
 here, they will be ashamed to do so and will become our
supporters<br>
 instead of rivals. I have rather played the coquette, but--it
is<br>
 delightful that the first nonsense with which one fools a
man<br>
 sufficed."</p>

<p>The day on which a serious and unlooked-for struggle about
this<br>
 appointment began, after a ministerial dinner which preceded one
of<br>
 those receptions which ministers regard as public, des Lupeaulx
was<br>
 standing beside the fireplace near the minister's wife. While
taking<br>
 his coffee he once more included Madame Rabourdin among the
seven or<br>
 eight really superior women in Paris. Several times already he
had<br>
 staked Madame Rabourdin very much as Corporal Trim staked his
cap.</p>

<p>"Don't say that too often, my dear friend, or you will injure
her,"<br>
 said the minister's wife, half-laughing.</p>

<p>Women never like to hear the praise of other women; they keep
silence<br>
 themselves to lessen its effect.</p>

<p>"Poor La Billardiere is dying," remarked his Excellency the
minister;<br>
 "that place falls to Rabourdin, one of our most able men, and to
whom<br>
 our predecessors did not behave well, though one of them
actually owed<br>
 his position in the prefecture of police under the Empire to a
certain<br>
 great personage who was interested in Rabourdin. But, my dear
friend,<br>
 you are still young enough to be loved by a pretty woman for<br>
 yourself--"</p>

<p>"If La Billardiere's place is given to Rabourdin I may be
believed<br>
 when I praise the superiority of his wife," replied des
Lupeaulx,<br>
 piqued by the minister's sarcasm; "but if Madame la Comtesse
would be<br>
 willing to judge for herself--"</p>

<p>"You want me to invite her to my next ball, don't you? Your
clever<br>
 woman will meet a knot of other women who only come here to
laugh at<br>
 us, and when they hear 'Madame Rabourdin' announced--"</p>

<p>"But Madame Firmiani is announced at the Foreign Office
parties?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but she was born a Cadignan!" said the newly created
count, with<br>
 a savage look at his general-secretary, for neither he nor his
wife<br>
 were noble.</p>

<p>The persons present thought important matters were being
talked over,<br>
 and the solicitors for favors and appointments kept at a
little<br>
 distance. When des Lupeaulx left the room the countess said to
her<br>
 husband, "I think des Lupeaulx is in love."</p>

<p>"For the first time in his life, then," he replied, shrugging
his<br>
 shoulders, as much as to inform his wife that des Lupeaulx did
not<br>
 concern himself with such nonsense.</p>

<p>Just then the minister saw a deputy of the Right Centre enter
the<br>
 room, and he left his wife abruptly to cajole an undecided vote.
But<br>
 the deputy, under the blow of a sudden and unexpected disaster,
wanted<br>
 to make sure of a protector and he had come to announce
privately that<br>
 in a few days he should be compelled to resign. Thus forewarned,
the<br>
 minister would be able to open his batteries for the new
election<br>
 before those of the opposition.</p>

<p>The minister, or to speak correctly, des Lupeaulx had invited
to<br>
 dinner on this occasion one of those irremovable officials who,
as we<br>
 have said, are to be found in every ministry; an individual
much<br>
 embarrassed by his own person, who, in his desire to maintain
a<br>
 dignified appearance, was standing erect and rigid on his two
legs,<br>
 held well together like the Greek hermae. This functionary
waited near<br>
 the fireplace to thank the secretary, whose abrupt and
unexpected<br>
 departure from the room disconcerted him at the moment when he
was<br>
 about to turn a compliment. This official was the cashier of
the<br>
 ministry, the only clerk who did not tremble when the
government<br>
 changed hands.</p>

<p>At the time of which we write, the Chamber did not meddle
shabbily<br>
 with the budget, as it does in the deplorable days in which we
now<br>
 live; it did not contemptibly reduce ministerial emoluments, nor
save,<br>
 as they say in the kitchen, the candle-ends; on the contrary,
it<br>
 granted to each minister taking charge of a public department
an<br>
 indemnity, called an "outfit." It costs, alas, as much to enter
on the<br>
 duties of a minister as to retire from them; indeed, the
entrance<br>
 involves expenses of all kinds which it is quite impossible
to<br>
 inventory. This indemnity amounted to the pretty little sum of
twenty-<br>
 five thousand francs. When the appointment of a new minister
was<br>
 gazetted in the "Moniteur," and the greater or lesser
officials,<br>
 clustering round the stoves or before the fireplaces and shaking
in<br>
 their shoes, asked themselves: "What will he do? will he
increase the<br>
 number of clerks? will he dismiss two to make room for three?"
the<br>
 cashier tranquilly took out twenty-five clean bank-bills and
pinned<br>
 them together with a satisfied expression on his beadle face.
The next<br>
 day he mounted the private staircase and had himself ushered
into the<br>
 minister's presence by the lackeys, who considered the money and
the<br>
 keeper of money, the contents and the container, the idea and
the<br>
 form, as one and the same power. The cashier caught the
ministerial<br>
 pair at the dawn of official delight, when the newly
appointed<br>
 statesman is benign and affable. To the minister's inquiry as to
what<br>
 brings him there, he replies with the bank-notes,--informing
his<br>
 Excellency that he hastens to pay him the customary
indemnity.<br>
 Moreover, he explains the matter to the minister's wife, who
never<br>
 fails to draw freely upon the fund, and sometimes takes all, for
the<br>
 "outfit" is looked upon as a household affair. The cashier
then<br>
 proceeds to turn a compliment, and to slip in a few politic
phrases:<br>
 "If his Excellency would deign to retain him; if, satisfied with
his<br>
 purely mechanical services, he would," etc. As a man who
brings<br>
 twenty-five thousand francs is always a worthy official, the
cashier<br>
 is sure not to leave without his confirmation to the post from
which<br>
 he has seen a succession of ministers come and go during a
period of,<br>
 perhaps, twenty-five years. His next step is to place himself at
the<br>
 orders of Madame; he brings the monthly thirteen thousand
francs<br>
 whenever wanted; he advances or delays the payment as requested,
and<br>
 thus manages to obtain, as they said in the monasteries, a voice
in<br>
 the chapter.</p>

<p><br>
 Formerly book-keeper at the Treasury, when that establishment
kept its<br>
 books by double entry, the Sieur Saillard was compensated for
the loss<br>
 of that position by his appointment as cashier of a ministry. He
was a<br>
 bulky, fat man, very strong in the matter of book-keeping, and
very<br>
 weak in everything else; round as a round O, simple as
how-do-you-do,<br>
 --a man who came to his office with measured steps, like those
of an<br>
 elephant, and returned with the same measured tread to the
place<br>
 Royale, where he lived on the ground-floor of an old mansion
belonging<br>
 to him. He usually had a companion on the way in the person
of<br>
 Monsieur Isidore Baudoyer, head of a bureau in Monsieur de
la<br>
 Billardiere's division, consequently one of Rabourdin's
colleagues.<br>
 Baudoyer was married to Elisabeth Saillard, the cashier's
only<br>
 daughter, and had hired, very naturally, the apartments above
those of<br>
 his father-in-law. No one at the ministry had the slightest
doubt that<br>
 Saillard was a blockhead, but neither had any one ever found out
how<br>
 far his stupidity could go; it was too compact to be examined;
it did<br>
 not ring hollow; it absorbed everything and gave nothing out.
Bixiou<br>
 (a clerk of whom more anon) caricatured the cashier by drawing a
head<br>
 in a wig at the top of an egg, and two little legs at the other
end,<br>
 with this inscription: "Born to pay out and take in without<br>
 blundering. A little less luck, and he might have been lackey to
the<br>
 bank of France; a little more ambition, and he could have
been<br>
 honorably discharged."</p>

<p>At the moment of which we are now writing, the minister was
looking at<br>
 his cashier very much as we gaze at a window or a cornice,
without<br>
 supposing that either can hear us, or fathom our secret
thoughts.</p>

<p>"I am all the more anxious that we should settle everything
with the<br>
 prefect in the quietest way, because des Lupeaulx has designs
upon the<br>
 place for himself," said the minister, continuing his talk with
the<br>
 deputy; "his paltry little estate is in your arrondissement; we
won't<br>
 want him as deputy."</p>

<p>"He has neither years nor rentals enough to be eligible," said
the<br>
 deputy.</p>

<p>"That may be; but you know how it was decided for Casimir
Perier as to<br>
 age; and as to worldly possessions, des Lupeaulx does
possess<br>
 something,--not much, it is true, but the law does not take
into<br>
 account increase, which he may very well obtain; commissions
have wide<br>
 margins for the deputies of the Centre, you know, and we cannot
openly<br>
 oppose the good-will that is shown to this dear friend."</p>

<p>"But where would he get the money?"</p>

<p>"How did Manuel manage to become the owner of a house in
Paris?" cried<br>
 the minister.</p>

<p>The cashier listened and heard, but reluctantly and against
his will.<br>
 These rapid remarks, murmured as they were, struck his ear by
one of<br>
 those acoustic rebounds which are very little studied. As he
heard<br>
 these political confidences, however, a keen alarm took
possession of<br>
 his soul. He was one of those simple-minded beings, who are
shocked at<br>
 listening to anything they are not intended to hear, or entering
where<br>
 they are not invited, and seeming bold when they are really
timid,<br>
 inquisitive where they are truly discreet. The cashier
accordingly<br>
 began to glide along the carpet and edge himself away, so that
the<br>
 minister saw him at a distance when he first took notice of
him.<br>
 Saillard was a ministerial henchman absolutely incapable of<br>
 indiscretion; even if the minister had known that he had
overheard a<br>
 secret he had only to whisper "motus" in his ear to be sure it
was<br>
 perfectly safe. The cashier, however, took advantage of an
influx of<br>
 office-seekers, to slip out and get into his hackney-coach
(hired by<br>
 the hour for these costly entertainments), and to return to his
home<br>
 in the place Royale.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h4>THE TEREDOS NAVALIS, OTHERWISE CALLED SHIP-WORM</h4>

<p>While old Saillard was driving across Paris his son-in-law,
Isidore<br>
 Baudoyer, and his daughter, Elisabeth, Baudoyer's wife, were
playing a<br>
 virtuous game of boston with their confessor, the Abbe Gaudron,
in<br>
 company with a few neighbors and a certain Martin Falleix, a
brass-<br>
 founder in the fauborg Saint-Antoine, to whom Saillard had
loaned the<br>
 necessary money to establish a business. This Falleix, a
respectable<br>
 Auvergnat who had come to seek his fortune in Paris with his
smelting-<br>
 pot on his back, had found immediate employment with the firm
of<br>
 Brezac, collectors of metals and other relics from all chateaux
in the<br>
 provinces. About twenty-seven years of age, and spoiled, like
others,<br>
 by success, Martin Falleix had had the luck to become the active
agent<br>
 of Monsieur Saillard, the sleeping-partner in the working out of
a<br>
 discovery made by Falleix in smelting (patent of invention and
gold<br>
 medal granted at the exposition of 1825). Madame Baudoyer, whose
only<br>
 daughter was treading--to use an expression of old
Saillard's--on the<br>
 tail of her twelve years, laid claim to Falleix, a thickset,
swarthy,<br>
 active young fellow, of shrewd principles, whose education she
was<br>
 superintending. The said education, according to her ideas,
consisted<br>
 in teaching him to play boston, to hold his cards properly, and
not to<br>
 let others see his game; to shave himself regularly before he
came to<br>
 the house, and to wash his hands with good cleansing soap; not
to<br>
 swear, to speak her kind of French, to wear boots instead of
shoes,<br>
 cotton shirts instead of sacking, and to brush up his hair
instead of<br>
 plastering it flat. During the preceding week Elisabeth had
finally<br>
 succeeded in persuading Falleix to give up wearing a pair of
enormous<br>
 flat earrings resembling hoops.</p>

<p><br>
 "You go too far, Madame Baudoyer," he said, seeing her
satisfaction at<br>
 the final sacrifice; "you order me about too much. You make me
clean<br>
 my teeth, which loosens them; presently you will want me to
brush my<br>
 nails and curl my hair, which won't do at all in our business;
we<br>
 don't like dandies."</p>

<p>Elisabeth Baudoyer, nee Saillard, is one of those persons who
escape<br>
 portraiture through their utter commonness; yet who ought to
be<br>
 sketched, because they are specimens of that second-rate
Parisian<br>
 bourgeoisie which occupies a place above the well-to-do artisan
and<br>
 below the upper middle classes,--a tribe whose virtues are
well-nigh<br>
 vices, whose defects are never kindly, but whose habits and
manners,<br>
 dull and insipid though they be, are not without a certain<br>
 originality. Something pinched and puny about Elisabeth Saillard
was<br>
 painful to the eye. Her figure, scarcely over four feet in
height, was<br>
 so thin that the waist measured less than twenty inches. Her
small<br>
 features, which clustered close about the nose, gave her face a
vague<br>
 resemblance to a weasel's snout. Though she was past thirty
years old<br>
 she looked scarcely more than sixteen. Her eyes, of porcelain
blue,<br>
 overweighted by heavy eyelids which fell nearly straight from
the arch<br>
 of the eyebrows, had little light in them. Everything about
her<br>
 appearance was commonplace: witness her flaxen hair, tending
to<br>
 whiteness; her flat forehead, from which the light did not
reflect;<br>
 and her dull complexion, with gray, almost leaden, tones. The
lower<br>
 part of the face, more triangular than oval, ended irregularly
the<br>
 otherwise irregular outline of her face. Her voice had a rather
pretty<br>
 range of intonation, from sharp to sweet. Elisabeth was a
perfect<br>
 specimen of the second-rate little bourgeoisie who lectures
her<br>
 husband behind the curtains; obtains no credit for her virtues;
is<br>
 ambitious without intelligent object, and solely through the<br>
 development of her domestic selfishness. Had she lived in the
country<br>
 she would have bought up adjacent land; being, as she was,
connected<br>
 with the administration, she was determined to push her way. If
we<br>
 relate the life of her father and mother, we shall show the sort
of<br>
 woman she was by a picture of her childhood and youth.</p>

<p>Monsieur Saillard married the daughter of an upholsterer
keeping shop<br>
 under the arcades of the Market. Limited means compelled
Monsieur and<br>
 Madame Saillard at their start in life to bear constant
privation.<br>
 After thirty-three years of married life, and twenty-nine years
of<br>
 toil in a government office, the property of "the
Saillards"--their<br>
 circle of acquaintance called them so--consisted of sixty
thousand<br>
 francs entrusted to Falleix, the house in the place Royale,
bought for<br>
 forty thousand in 1804, and thirty-six thousand francs given in
dowry<br>
 to their daughter Elisabeth. Out of this capital about fifty
thousand<br>
 came to them by the will of the widow Bidault, Madame
Saillard's<br>
 mother. Saillard's salary from the government had always been
four<br>
 thousand five hundred francs a year, and no more; his situation
was a<br>
 blind alley that led nowhere, and had tempted no one to
supersede him.<br>
 Those ninety thousand francs, put together sou by sou, were the
fruit<br>
 therefore of a sordid economy unintelligently employed. In fact,
the<br>
 Saillards did not know how better to manage their savings than
to<br>
 carry them, five thousand francs at a time, to their notary,
Monsieur<br>
 Sorbier, Cardot's predecessor, and let him invest them at five
per<br>
 cent in first mortgages, with the wife's rights reserved in case
the<br>
 borrower was married! In 1804 Madame Saillard obtained a
government<br>
 office for the sale of stamped papers, a circumstance which
brought a<br>
 servant into the household for the first time. At the time of
which we<br>
 write, the house, which was worth a hundred thousand francs,
brought<br>
 in a rental of eight thousand. Falleix paid seven per cent for
the<br>
 sixty thousand invested in the foundry, besides an equal
division of<br>
 profits. The Saillards were therefore enjoying an income of not
less<br>
 than seventeen thousand francs a year. The whole ambition of the
good<br>
 man now centred on obtaining the cross of the Legion and his
retiring<br>
 pension.</p>

<p>Elisabeth, the only child, had toiled steadily from infancy in
a home<br>
 where the customs of life were rigid and the ideas simple. A new
hat<br>
 for Saillard was a matter of deliberation; the time a coat could
last<br>
 was estimated and discussed; umbrellas were carefully hung up by
means<br>
 of a brass buckle. Since 1804 no repairs of any kind had been
done to<br>
 the house. The Saillards kept the ground-floor in precisely the
state<br>
 in which their predecessor left it. The gilding of the
pier-glasses<br>
 was rubbed off; the paint on the cornices was hardly visible
through<br>
 the layers of dust that time had collected. The fine large rooms
still<br>
 retained certain sculptured marble mantel-pieces and ceilings,
worthy<br>
 of Versailles, together with the old furniture of the widow
Bidault.<br>
 The latter consisted of a curious mixture of walnut
armchairs,<br>
 disjointed, and covered with tapestry; rosewood bureaus; round
tables<br>
 on single pedestals, with brass railings and cracked marble
tops; one<br>
 superb Boulle secretary, the value of which style had not yet
been<br>
 recognized; in short, a chaos of bargains picked up by the
worthy<br>
 widow,--pictures bought for the sake of the frames, china
services of<br>
 a composite order; to wit, a magnificent Japanese dessert set,
and all<br>
 the rest porcelains of various makes, unmatched silver plate,
old<br>
 glass, fine damask, and a four-post bedstead, hung with curtains
and<br>
 garnished with plumes.</p>

<p>Amid these curious relics, Madame Saillard always sat on a
sofa of<br>
 modern mahogany, near a fireplace full of ashes and without
fire, on<br>
 the mantel-shelf of which stood a clock, some antique
bronzes,<br>
 candelabra with paper flowers but no candles, for the
careful<br>
 housewife lighted the room with a tall tallow candle always
guttering<br>
 down into the flat brass candlestick which held it. Madame
Saillard's<br>
 face, despite its wrinkles, was expressive of obstinacy and
severity,<br>
 narrowness of ideas, an uprightness that might be called
quadrangular,<br>
 a religion without piety, straightforward, candid avarice, and
the<br>
 peace of a quiet conscience. You may see in certain Flemish
pictures<br>
 the wives of burgomasters cut out by nature on the same pattern
and<br>
 wonderfully reproduced on canvas; but these dames wear fine
robes of<br>
 velvet and precious stuffs, whereas Madame Saillard possessed
no<br>
 robes, only that venerable garment called in Touraine and
Picardy<br>
 "cottes," elsewhere petticoats, or skirts pleated behind and on
each<br>
 side, with other skirts hanging over them. Her bust was inclosed
in<br>
 what was called a "casaquin," another obsolete name for a short
gown<br>
 or jacket. She continued to wear a cap with starched wings, and
shoes<br>
 with high heels. Though she was now fifty-seven years old, and
her<br>
 lifetime of vigorous household work ought now to be rewarded
with<br>
 well-earned repose, she was incessantly employed in knitting
her<br>
 husband's stockings and her own, and those of an uncle, just as
her<br>
 countrywomen knit them, moving about the room, talking, pacing
up and<br>
 down the garden, or looking round the kitchen to watch what was
going<br>
 on.</p>

<p>The Saillard's avarice, which was really imposed on them in
the first<br>
 instance by dire necessity, was now a second nature. When the
cashier<br>
 got back from the office, he laid aside his coat, and went to
work in<br>
 the large garden, shut off from the courtyard by an iron
railing, and<br>
 which the family reserved to itself. For years Elisabeth,
the<br>
 daughter, went to market every morning with her mother, and the
two<br>
 did all the work of the house. The mother cooked well,
especially a<br>
 duck with turnips; but, according to Saillard, no one could
equal<br>
 Elisabeth in hashing the remains of a leg of mutton with onions.
"You<br>
 might eat your boots with those onions and not know it," he
remarked.<br>
 As soon as Elisabeth knew how to hold a needle, her mother had
her<br>
 mend the household linen and her father's coats. Always at work,
like<br>
 a servant, she never went out alone. Though living close by
the<br>
 boulevard du Temple, where Franconi, La Gaite, and
l'Ambigu-Comique<br>
 were within a stone's throw, and, further on, the
Porte-Saint-Martin,<br>
 Elisabeth had never seen a comedy. When she asked to "see what
it was<br>
 like" (with the Abbe Gaudron's permission, be it understood),
Monsieur<br>
 Baudoyer took her--for the glory of the thing, and to show her
the<br>
 finest that was to be seen--to the Opera, where they were
playing "The<br>
 Chinese Laborer." Elisabeth thought "the comedy" as wearisome as
the<br>
 plague of flies, and never wished to see another. On Sundays,
after<br>
 walking four times to and fro between the place Royale and
Saint-<br>
 Paul's church (for her mother made her practise the precepts and
the<br>
 duties of religion), her parents took her to the pavement in
front of<br>
 the Cafe Ture, where they sat on chairs placed between a railing
and<br>
 the wall. The Saillards always made haste to reach the place
early so<br>
 as to choose the best seats, and found much entertainment in
watching<br>
 the passers-by. In those days the Cafe Ture was the rendezvous
of the<br>
 fashionable society of the Marais, the faubourg Saint-Antoine,
and the<br>
 circumjacent regions.</p>

<p>Elisabeth never wore anything but cotton gowns in summer and
merino in<br>
 the winter, which she made herself. Her mother gave her twenty
francs<br>
 a month for her expenses, but her father, who was very fond of
her,<br>
 mitigated this rigorous treatment with a few presents. She never
read<br>
 what the Abbe Gaudron, vicar of Saint-Paul's and the family
director,<br>
 called profane books. This discipline had borne fruit. Forced
to<br>
 employ her feelings on some passion or other, Elisabeth became
eager<br>
 after gain. Though she was not lacking in sense or
perspicacity,<br>
 religious theories, and her complete ignorance of higher
emotions had<br>
 encircled all her faculties with an iron hand; they were
exercised<br>
 solely on the commonest things of life; spent in a few
directions they<br>
 were able to concentrate themselves on a matter in hand.
Repressed by<br>
 religious devotion, her natural intelligence exercised itself
within<br>
 the limits marked out by cases of conscience, which form a mine
of<br>
 subtleties among which self-interest selects its subterfuges.
Like<br>
 those saintly personages in whom religion does not stifle
ambition,<br>
 Elisabeth was capable of requiring others to do a blamable
action that<br>
 she might reap the fruits; and she would have been, like them
again,<br>
 implacable as to her dues and dissembling in her actions.
Once<br>
 offended, she watched her adversaries with the perfidious
patience of<br>
 a cat, and was capable of bringing about some cold and
complete<br>
 vengeance, and then laying it to the account of God. Until
her<br>
 marriage the Saillards lived without other society than that of
the<br>
 Abbe Gaudron, a priest from Auvergne appointed vicar of
Saint-Paul's<br>
 after the restoration of Catholic worship. Besides this
ecclesiastic,<br>
 who was a friend of the late Madame Bidault, a paternal uncle
of<br>
 Madame Saillard, an old paper-dealer retired from business ever
since<br>
 the year II. of the Republic, and now sixty-nine years old, came
to<br>
 see them on Sundays only, because on that day no government
business<br>
 went on.</p>

<p>This little old man, with a livid face blazoned by the red
nose of a<br>
 tippler and lighted by two gleaming vulture eyes, allowed his
gray<br>
 hair to hang loose under a three-cornered hat, wore breeches
with<br>
 straps that extended beyond the buckles, cotton stockings of
mottled<br>
 thread knitted by his niece, whom he always called "the
little<br>
 Saillard," stout shoes with silver buckles, and a surtout coat
of<br>
 mixed colors. He looked very much like those
verger-beadle-bell-<br>
 ringing-grave-digging-parish-clerks who are taken to be
caricatures<br>
 until we see them performing their various functions. On the
present<br>
 occasion he had come on foot to dine with the Saillards,
intending to<br>
 return in the same way to the rue Greneta, where he lived on the
third<br>
 floor of an old house. His business was that of discounting
commercial<br>
 paper in the quartier Saint-Martin, where he was known by the
nickname<br>
 of "Gigonnet," from the nervous convulsive movement with which
he<br>
 lifted his legs in walking, like a cat. Monsieur Bidault began
this<br>
 business in the year II. in partnership with a dutchman
named<br>
 Werbrust, a friend of Gobseck.</p>

<p>Some time later Saillard made the acquaintance of Monsieur and
Madame<br>
 Transon, wholesale dealers in pottery, with an establishment in
the<br>
 rue de Lesdiguieres, who took an interest in Elisabeth and
introduced<br>
 young Isadore Baudoyer to the family with the intention of
marrying<br>
 her. Gigonnet approved of the match, for he had long employed
a<br>
 certain Mitral, uncle of the young man, as clerk. Monsieur and
Madame<br>
 Baudoyer, father and mother of Isidore, highly respected
leather-<br>
 dressers in the rue Censier, had slowly made a moderate fortune
out of<br>
 a small trade. After marrying their only son, on whom they
settled<br>
 fifty thousand francs, they determined to live in the country,
and had<br>
 lately removed to the neighborhood of Ile-d'Adam, where after a
time<br>
 they were joined by Mitral. They frequently came to Paris,
however,<br>
 where they kept a corner in the house in the rue Censier which
they<br>
 gave to Isidore on his marriage. The elder Baudoyers had an
income of<br>
 about three thousand francs left to live upon after establishing
their<br>
 son.</p>

<p>Mitral was a being with a sinister wig, a face the color of
Seine<br>
 water, lighted by a pair of Spanish-tobacco-colored eyes, cold
as a<br>
 well-rope, always smelling a rat, and close-mouthed about
his<br>
 property. He probably made his fortune in his own hole and
corner,<br>
 just as Werbrust and Gigonnet made theirs in the quartier
Saint-<br>
 Martin.</p>

<p>Though the Saillards' circle of acquaintance increased,
neither their<br>
 ideas nor their manners and customs changed. The saint's-days
of<br>
 father, mother, daughter, son-in-law, and grandchild were
carefully<br>
 observed, also the anniversaries of birth and marriage,
Easter,<br>
 Christmas, New Year's day, and Epiphany. These festivals were
preceded<br>
 by great domestic sweepings and a universal clearing up of the
house,<br>
 which added an element of usefulness to the ceremonies. When
the<br>
 festival day came, the presents were offered with much pomp and
an<br>
 accompaniment of flowers,--silk stockings or a fur cap for
old<br>
 Saillard; gold earrings and articles of plate for Elisabeth or
her<br>
 husband, for whom, little by little, the parents were
accumulating a<br>
 whole silver service; silk petticoats for Madame Saillard, who
laid<br>
 the stuff by and never made it up. The recipient of these gifts
was<br>
 placed in an armchair and asked by those present for a certain
length<br>
 of time, "Guess what we have for you!" Then came a splendid
dinner,<br>
 lasting at least five hours, to which were invited the Abbe
Gaudron,<br>
 Falleix, Rabourdin, Monsieur Godard, under-head-clerk to
Monsieur<br>
 Baudoyer, Monsieur Bataille, captain of the company of the
National<br>
 Guard to which Saillard and his son-in-law belonged. Monsieur
Cardot,<br>
 who was invariably asked, did as Rabourdin did, namely, accepted
one<br>
 invitation out of six. The company sang at dessert, shook hands
and<br>
 embraced with enthusiasm, wishing each other all manner of
happiness;<br>
 the presents were exhibited and the opinion of the guests asked
about<br>
 them. The day Saillard received his fur cap he wore it during
the<br>
 dessert, to the satisfaction of all present. At night, mere
ordinary<br>
 acquaintances were bidden, and dancing went on till very
late,<br>
 formerly to the music of one violin, but for the last six
years<br>
 Monsieur Godard, who was a great flute player, contributed
the<br>
 piercing tones of a flageolet to the festivity. The cook,
Madame<br>
 Baudoyer's nurse, and old Catherine, Madame Saillard's
woman-servant,<br>
 together with the porter or his wife, stood looking on at the
door of<br>
 the salon. The servants always received three francs on
these<br>
 occasions to buy themselves wine or coffee.</p>

<p>This little circle looked upon Saillard and Baudoyer as
transcendent<br>
 beings; they were government officers; they had risen by their
own<br>
 merits; they worked, it was said, with the minister himself;
they owed<br>
 their fortune to their talents; they were politicians. Baudoyer
was<br>
 considered the more able of the two; his position as head of a
bureau<br>
 presupposed labor that was more intricate and arduous than that
of a<br>
 cashier. Moreover, Isidore, though the son of a leather-dresser,
had<br>
 had the genius to study and to cast aside his father's business
and<br>
 find a career in politics, which had led him to a post of
eminence. In<br>
 short, silent and uncommunicative as he was, he was looked upon
as a<br>
 deep thinker, and perhaps, said the admiring circle, he would
some day<br>
 become deputy of the eighth arrondissement. As Gigonnet listened
to<br>
 such remarks as these, he pressed his already pinched lips
closer<br>
 together, and threw a glance at his great-niece, Elisabeth.</p>

<p>In person, Isidore was a tall, stout man of thirty-seven,
who<br>
 perspired freely, and whose head looked as if he had water on
the<br>
 brain. This enormous head, covered with chestnut hair cropped
close,<br>
 was joined to the neck by rolls of flesh which overhung the
collar of<br>
 his coat. He had the arms of Hercules, hands worthy of Domitian,
a<br>
 stomach which sobriety held within the limits of the majestic,
to use<br>
 a saying of Brillaet-Savarin. His face was a good deal like that
of<br>
 the Emperor Alexander. The Tartar type was in the little eyes
and the<br>
 flattened nose turned slightly up, in the frigid lips and the
short<br>
 chin. The forehead was low and narrow. Though his temperament
was<br>
 lymphatic, the devout Isidore was under the influence of a
conjugal<br>
 passion which time did not lessen.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of his resemblance to the handsome Russian
Emperor<br>
 and the terrible Domitian, Isidore Baudoyer was nothing more
than a<br>
 political office-holder, of little ability as head of his
department,<br>
 a cut-and-dried routine man, who concealed the fact that he was
a<br>
 flabby cipher by so ponderous a personality that no scalpel
could cut<br>
 deep enough to let the operator see into him. His severe
studies, in<br>
 which he had shown the patience and sagacity of an ox, and his
square<br>
 head, deceived his parents, who firmly believed him an
extraordinary<br>
 man. Pedantic and hypercritical, meddlesome and fault-finding,
he was<br>
 a terror to the clerks under him, whom he worried in their
work,<br>
 enforcing the rules rigorously, and arriving himself with
such<br>
 terrible punctuality that not one of them dared to be a moment
late.<br>
 Baudoyer wore a blue coat with gilt buttons, a chamois
waistcoat, gray<br>
 trousers and cravats of various colors. His feet were large
and<br>
 ill-shod. From the chain of his watch depended an enormous bunch
of<br>
 old trinkets, among which in 1824 he still wore "American
beads,"<br>
 which were very much the fashion in the year VII.</p>

<p>In the bosom of this family, bound together by the force of
religious<br>
 ties, by the inflexibility of its customs, by one solitary
emotion,<br>
 that of avarice, a passion which was now as it were its
compass,<br>
 Elisabeth was forced to commune with herself, instead of
imparting her<br>
 ideas to those around her, for she felt herself without equals
in mind<br>
 who could comprehend her. Though facts compelled her to judge
her<br>
 husband, her religious duty led her to keep up as best she could
a<br>
 favorable opinion of him; she showed him marked respect; honored
him<br>
 as the father of her child, her husband, the temporal power, as
the<br>
 vicar of Saint-Paul's told her. She would have thought it a
mortal sin<br>
 to make a single gesture, or give a single glance, or say a
single<br>
 word which would reveal to others her real opinion of the
imbecile<br>
 Baudoyer. She even professed to obey passively all his wishes.
But her<br>
 ears were receptive of many things; she thought them over,
weighed and<br>
 compared them in the solitude of her mind, and judged so soberly
of<br>
 men and events that at the time when our history begins she was
the<br>
 hidden oracle of the two functionaries, her husband and father,
who<br>
 had, unconsciously, come to do nothing whatever without
consulting<br>
 her. Old Saillard would say, innocently, "Isn't she clever,
that<br>
 Elisabeth of mine?" But Baudoyer, too great a fool not to be
puffed up<br>
 by the false reputation the quartier Saint-Antoine bestowed upon
him,<br>
 denied his wife's cleverness all the while that he was making
use of<br>
 it.</p>

<p>Elisabeth had long felt sure that her uncle Bidault, otherwise
called<br>
 Gigonnet, was rich and handled vast sums of money. Enlightened
by<br>
 self-interest, she had come to understand Monsieur des Lupeaulx
far<br>
 better than the minister understood him. Finding herself married
to a<br>
 fool, she never allowed herself to think that life might have
gone<br>
 better with her, she only imagined the possibility of better
things<br>
 without expecting or wishing to attain them. All her best
affections<br>
 found their vocation in her love for her daughter, to whom she
spared<br>
 the pains and privations she had borne in her own childhood;
she<br>
 believed that in this affection she had her full share in the
world of<br>
 feeling. Solely for her daughter's sake she had persuaded her
father<br>
 to take the important step of going into partnership with
Falleix.<br>
 Falleix had been brought to the Saillard's house by old Bidault,
who<br>
 lent him money on his merchandise. Falleix thought his old
countryman<br>
 extortionate, and complained to the Saillards that Gigonnet
demanded<br>
 eighteen per cent from an Auvergnat. Madame Saillard ventured
to<br>
 remonstrate with her uncle.</p>

<p>"It is just because he is an Auvergnat that I take only
eighteen per<br>
 cent," said Gigonnet, when she spoke of him.</p>

<p>Falleix, who had made a discovery at the age of twenty-eight,
and<br>
 communicated it to Saillard, seemed to carry his heart in his
hand (an<br>
 expression of old Saillard's), and also seemed likely to make a
great<br>
 fortune. Elisabeth determined to husband him for her daughter
and<br>
 train him herself, having, as she calculated, seven years to do
it in.<br>
 Martin Falleix felt and showed the deepest respect for
Madame<br>
 Baudoyer, whose superior qualities he was able to recognize. If
he<br>
 were fated to make millions he would always belong to her
family,<br>
 where he had found a home. The little Baudoyer girl was
already<br>
 trained to bring him his tea and to take his hat.</p>

<p>On the evening of which we write, Monsieur Saillard, returning
from<br>
 the ministry, found a game of boston in full blast; Elisabeth
was<br>
 advising Falleix how to play; Madame Saillard was knitting in
the<br>
 chimney-corner and overlooking the cards of the vicar;
Monsieur<br>
 Baudoyer, motionless as a mile-stone, was employing his
mental<br>
 capacity in calculating how the cards were placed, and sat
opposite to<br>
 Mitral, who had come up from Ile-d'Adam for the Christmas
holidays. No<br>
 one moved as the cashier entered, and for some minutes he walked
up<br>
 and down the room, his fat face contracted with unaccustomed
thought.</p>

<p>"He is always so when he dines at the ministry," remarked
Madame<br>
 Saillard; "happily, it is only twice a year, or he'd die of
it.<br>
 Saillard was never made to be in the government-- Well, now, I
do<br>
 hope, Saillard," she continued in a loud tone, "that you are not
going<br>
 to keep on those silk breeches and that handsome coat. Go and
take<br>
 them off; don't wear them at home, my man."</p>

<p>"Your father has something on his mind," said Baudoyer to his
wife,<br>
 when the cashier was in his bedroom, undressing without any
fire.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Monsieur de la Billardiere is dead," said Elisabeth,
simply;<br>
 "and as he is anxious you should have the place, it worries
him."</p>

<p>"Can I be useful in any way?" said the vicar of Saint-Paul's;
"if so,<br>
 pray use my services. I have the honor to be known to Madame
la<br>
 Dauphine. These are days when public offices should be given
only to<br>
 faithful men, whose religious principles are not to be
shaken."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Falleix, "do men of merit need protectors
and<br>
 influence to get places in the government service? I am glad I
am an<br>
 iron-master; my customers know where to find a good
article--"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," interrupted Baudoyer, "the government is the
government;<br>
 never attack it in this house."</p>

<p>"You speak like the 'Constitutionel,'" said the vicar.</p>

<p>"The 'Constitutionel' never says anything different from
that,"<br>
 replied Baudoyer, who never read it.</p>

<p>The cashier believed his son-in-law to be as superior in
talent to<br>
 Rabourdin as God was greater than Saint-Crepin, to use his
own<br>
 expression; but the good man coveted this appointment in a<br>
 straightforward, honest way. Influenced by the feeling which
leads all<br>
 officials to seek promotion,--a violent, unreflecting, almost
brutal<br>
 passion,--he desired success, just as he desired the cross of
the<br>
 Legion of honor, without doing anything against his conscience
to<br>
 obtain it, and solely, as he believed, on the strength of his
son-in-<br>
 law's merits. To his thinking, a man who had patiently spent
twenty-<br>
 five years in a government office behind an iron railing had<br>
 sacrificed himself to his country and deserved the cross. But
all that<br>
 he dreamed of doing to promote his son-in-law's appointment in
La<br>
 Billardiere's place was to say a word to his Excellency's wife
when he<br>
 took her the month's salary.</p>

<p><br>
 "Well, Saillard, you look as if you had lost all your friends!
Do<br>
 speak; do, pray, tell us something," cried his wife when he came
back<br>
 into the room.</p>

<p>Saillard, after making a little sign to his daughter, turned
on his<br>
 heel to keep himself from talking politics before strangers.
When<br>
 Monsieur Mitral and the vicar had departed, Saillard rolled back
the<br>
 card-table and sat down in an armchair in the attitude he
always<br>
 assumed when about to tell some office-gossip,--a series of
movements<br>
 which answered the purpose of the three knocks given at the
Theatre-<br>
 Francais. After binding his wife, daughter, and son-in-law to
the<br>
 deepest secrecy,--for, however petty the gossip, their places,
as he<br>
 thought, depended on their discretion,--he related the<br>
 incomprehensible enigma of the resignation of a deputy, the
very<br>
 legitimate desire of the general-secretary to get elected to
the<br>
 place, and the secret opposition of the minister to this wish of
a man<br>
 who was one of his firmest supporters and most zealous workers.
This,<br>
 of course, brought down an avalanche of suppositions, flooded
with the<br>
 sapient arguments of the two officials, who sent back and forth
to<br>
 each other a wearisome flood of nonsense. Elisabeth quietly
asked<br>
 three questions:--</p>

<p>"If Monsieur des Lupeaulx is on our side, will Monsieur
Baudoyer be<br>
 appointed in Monsieur de la Billardiere's place?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! I should think so," cried the cashier.</p>

<p>"My uncle Bidault and Monsieur Gobseck helped in him 1814,"
thought<br>
 she. "Is he in debt?" she asked, aloud.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried the cashier with a hissing and prolonged sound on
the<br>
 last letter; "his salary was attached, but some of the higher
powers<br>
 released it by a bill at sight."</p>

<p>"Where is the des Lupeaulx estate?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know? in the part of the country where
your<br>
 grandfather and your great-uncle Bidault belong, in the
arrondissement<br>
 of the deputy who wants to resign."</p>

<p>When her colossus of a husband had gone to bed, Elisabeth
leaned over<br>
 him, and though he always treated her remarks as women's
nonsense, she<br>
 said, "Perhaps you will really get Monsieur de la
Billardiere's<br>
 place."</p>

<p>"There you go with your imaginations!" said Baudoyer; "leave
Monsieur<br>
 Gaudron to speak to the Dauphine and don't meddle with
politics."</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock, when all were asleep in the place Royale,
Monsieur<br>
 des Lupeaulx was leaving the Opera for the rue Duphot. This
particular<br>
 Wednesday was one of Madame Rabourdin's most brilliant evenings.
Many<br>
 of her customary guests came in from the theatres and swelled
the<br>
 company already assembled, among whom were several celebrities,
such<br>
 as: Canalis the poet, Schinner the painter, Dr. Bianchon, Lucien
de<br>
 Rubempre, Octave de Camps, the Comte de Granville, the Vicomte
de<br>
 Fontaine, du Bruel the vaudevillist, Andoche Finot the
journalist,<br>
 Derville, one of the best heads in the law courts, the Comte
du<br>
 Chatelet, deputy, du Tillet, banker, and several elegant young
men,<br>
 such as Paul de Manerville and the Vicomte de Portenduere.
Celestine<br>
 was pouring out tea when the general-secretary entered. Her
dress that<br>
 evening was very becoming; she wore a black velvet robe
without<br>
 ornament of any kind, a black gauze scarf, her hair smoothly
bound<br>
 about her head and raised in a heavy braided mass, with long
curls a<br>
 l'Anglaise falling on either side of her face. The charms
which<br>
 particularly distinguished this woman were the Italian ease of
her<br>
 artistic nature, her ready comprehension, and the grace with
which she<br>
 welcomed and promoted the least appearance of a wish on the part
of<br>
 others. Nature had given her an elegant, slender figure, which
could<br>
 sway lightly at a word, black eyes of oriental shape, able, like
those<br>
 of the Chinese women, to see out of their corners. She well knew
how<br>
 to manage a soft, insinuating voice, which threw a tender charm
into<br>
 every word, even such as she merely chanced to utter; her feet
were<br>
 like those we see in portraits where the painter boldly lies
and<br>
 flatters his sitter in the only way which does not compromise
anatomy.<br>
 Her complexion, a little yellow by day, like that of most
brunettes,<br>
 was dazzling at night under the wax candles, which brought out
the<br>
 brilliancy of her black hair and eyes. Her slender and
well-defined<br>
 outlines reminded an artist of the Venus of the Middle Ages
rendered<br>
 by Jean Goujon, the illustrious sculptor of Diane de
Poitiers.</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx stopped in the doorway, and leaned against the
woodwork.<br>
 This ferret of ideas did not deny himself the pleasure of spying
upon<br>
 sentiment, and this woman interested him more than any of the
others<br>
 to whom he had attached himself. Des Lupeaulx had reached an age
when<br>
 men assert pretensions in regard to women. The first white hairs
lead<br>
 to the latest passions, all the more violent because they are
astride<br>
 of vanishing powers and dawning weakness. The age of forty is
the age<br>
 of folly,--an age when man wants to be loved for himself;
whereas at<br>
 twenty-five life is so full that he has no wants. At twenty-five
he<br>
 overflows with vigor and wastes it with impunity, but at forty
he<br>
 learns that to use it in that way is to abuse it. The thoughts
that<br>
 came into des Lupeaulx's mind at this moment were melancholy
ones. The<br>
 nerves of the old beau relaxed; the agreeable smile, which
served as a<br>
 mask and made the character of his countenance, faded; the real
man<br>
 appeared, and he was horrible. Rabourdin caught sight of him
and<br>
 thought, "What has happened to him? can he be disgraced in any
way?"<br>
 The general-secretary was, however, only thinking how the
pretty<br>
 Madame Colleville, whose intentions were exactly those of
Madame<br>
 Rabourdin, had summarily abandoned him when it suited her to do
so.<br>
 Rabourdin caught the sham statesman's eyes fixed on his wife,
and he<br>
 recorded the look in his memory. He was too keen an observer not
to<br>
 understand des Lupeaulx to the bottom, and he deeply despised
him;<br>
 but, as with most busy men, his feelings and sentiments seldom
came to<br>
 the surface. Absorption in a beloved work is practically
equivalent to<br>
 the cleverest dissimulation, and thus it was that the opinions
and<br>
 ideas of Rabourdin were a sealed book to des Lupeaulx. The
former was<br>
 sorry to see the man in his house, but he was never willing to
oppose<br>
 his wife's wishes. At this particular moment, while he
talked<br>
 confidentially with a supernumerary of his office who was
destined,<br>
 later, to play an unconscious part in a political intrigue
resulting<br>
 from the death of La Billardiere, he watched, though half-<br>
 abstractedly, his wife and des Lupeaulx.</p>

<p>Here we must explain, as much for foreigners as for our
own<br>
 grandchildren, what a supernumerary in a government office in
Paris<br>
 means.</p>

<p>The supernumerary is to the administration what a choir-boy is
to a<br>
 church, what the company's child is to the regiment, what
the<br>
 figurante is to a theatre; something artless, naive, innocent, a
being<br>
 blinded by illusions. Without illusions what would become of any
of<br>
 us? They give strength to bear the res angusta domi of arts and
the<br>
 beginnings of all science by inspiring us with faith. Illusion
is<br>
 illimitable faith. Now the supernumerary has faith in the<br>
 administration; he never thinks it cold, cruel, and hard, as it
really<br>
 is. There are two kinds of supernumeraries, or hangers-on,--one
poor,<br>
 the other rich. The poor one is rich in hope and wants a place,
the<br>
 rich one is poor in spirit and wants nothing. A wealthy family
is not<br>
 so foolish as to put its able men into the administration. It
confides<br>
 an unfledged scion to some head-clerk, or gives him in charge of
a<br>
 directory who initiates him into what Bilboquet, that
profound<br>
 philosopher, called the high comedy of government; he is spared
all<br>
 the horrors of drudgery and is finally appointed to some
important<br>
 office. The rich supernumerary never alarms the other clerks;
they<br>
 know he does not endanger their interests, for he seeks only
the<br>
 highest posts in the administration. About the period of which
we<br>
 write many families were saying to themselves: "What can we do
with<br>
 our sons?" The army no longer offered a chance for fortune.
Special<br>
 careers, such as civil and military engineering, the navy,
mining, and<br>
 the professorial chair were all fenced about by strict
regulations or<br>
 to be obtained only by competition; whereas in the civil service
the<br>
 revolving wheel which turned clerks into prefects,
sub-prefects,<br>
 assessors, and collectors, like the figures in a magic lantern,
was<br>
 subjected to no such rules and entailed no drudgery. Through
this easy<br>
 gap emerged into life the rich supernumeraries who drove
their<br>
 tilburys, dressed well, and wore moustachios, all of them as
impudent<br>
 as parvenus. Journalists were apt to persecute the tribe, who
were<br>
 cousins, nephews, brothers, or other relatives of some minister,
some<br>
 deputy, or an influential peer. The humbler clerks regarded them
as a<br>
 means of influence.</p>

<p>The poor supernumerary, on the other hand, who is the only
real<br>
 worker, is almost always the son of some former clerk's widow,
who<br>
 lives on a meagre pension and sacrifices herself to support her
son<br>
 until he can get a place as copying-clerk, and then dies leaving
him<br>
 no nearer the head of his department than writer of deeds,
order-<br>
 clerks, or, possibly, under-head-clerk. Living always in some
locality<br>
 where rents are low, this humble supernumerary starts early from
home.<br>
 For him the Eastern question relates only to the morning skies.
To go<br>
 on foot and not get muddied, to save his clothes, and allow for
the<br>
 time he may lose in standing under shelter during a shower, are
the<br>
 preoccupations of his mind. The street pavements, the flaggings
of the<br>
 quays and the boulevards, when first laid down, were a boon to
him.<br>
 If, for some extraordinary reason, you happen to be in the
streets of<br>
 Paris at half-past seven or eight o'clock of a winter's morning,
and<br>
 see through piercing cold or fog or rain a timid, pale young man
loom<br>
 up, cigarless, take notice of his pockets. You will be sure to
see the<br>
 outline of a roll which his mother has given him to stay his
stomach<br>
 between breakfast and dinner. The guilelessness of the
supernumerary<br>
 does not last long. A youth enlightened by gleams by Parisian
life<br>
 soon measures the frightful distance that separates him from the
head-<br>
 clerkship, a distance which no mathematician, neither
Archimedes, nor<br>
 Leibnitz, nor Laplace has ever reckoned, the distance that
exists<br>
 between 0 and the figure 1. He begins to perceive the
impossibilities<br>
 of his career; he hears talk of favoritism; he discovers the
intrigues<br>
 of officials: he sees the questionable means by which his
superiors<br>
 have pushed their way,--one has married a young woman who made a
false<br>
 step; another, the natural daughter of a minister; this one
shouldered<br>
 the responsibility of another's fault; that one, full of talent,
risks<br>
 his health in doing, with the perseverance of a mole, prodigies
of<br>
 work which the man of influence feels incapable of doing for
himself,<br>
 though he takes the credit. Everything is known in a
government<br>
 office. The incapable man has a wife with a clear head, who has
pushed<br>
 him along and got him nominated for deputy; if he has not
talent<br>
 enough for an office, he cabals in the Chamber. The wife of
another<br>
 has a statesman at her feet. A third is the hidden informant of
a<br>
 powerful journalist. Often the disgusted and hopeless
supernumerary<br>
 sends in his resignation. About three fourths of his class leave
the<br>
 government employ without ever obtaining an appointment, and
their<br>
 number is winnowed down to either those young men who are
foolish or<br>
 obstinate enough to say to themselves, "I have been here three
years,<br>
 and I must end sooner or later by getting a place," or to those
who<br>
 are conscious of a vocation for the work. Undoubtedly the
position of<br>
 supernumerary in a government office is precisely what the
novitiate<br>
 is in a religious order,--a trial. It is a rough trial. The
State<br>
 discovers how many of them can bear hunger, thirst, and penury
without<br>
 breaking down, how many can toil without revolting against it;
it<br>
 learns which temperaments can bear up under the horrible
experience--<br>
 or if you like, the disease--of government official life. From
this<br>
 point of view the apprenticeship of the supernumerary, instead
of<br>
 being an infamous device of the government to obtain labor
gratis,<br>
 becomes a useful institution.</p>

<p>The young man with whom Rabourdin was talking was a poor
supernumerary<br>
 named Sebastien de la Roche, who had picked his way on the
points of<br>
 his toes, without incurring the least splash upon his boots,
from the<br>
 rue du Roi-Dore in the Marais. He talked of his mamma, and dared
not<br>
 raise his eyes to Madame Rabourdin, whose house appeared to him
as<br>
 gorgeous as the Louvre. He was careful to show his gloves,
well<br>
 cleaned with india-rubber, as little as he could. His poor
mother had<br>
 put five francs in his pocket in case it became absolutely
necessary<br>
 that he should play cards; but she enjoined him to take nothing,
to<br>
 remain standing, and to be very careful not to knock over a lamp
or<br>
 the bric-a-brac from an etagere. His dress was all of the
strictest<br>
 black. His fair face, his eyes, of a fine shade of green with
golden<br>
 reflections, were in keeping with a handsome head of auburn
hair. The<br>
 poor lad looked furtively at Madame Rabourdin, whispering to
himself,<br>
 "How beautiful!" and was likely to dream of that fairy when he
went to<br>
 bed.</p>

<p>Rabourdin had noted a vocation for his work in the lad, and as
he<br>
 himself took the whole service seriously, he felt a lively
interest in<br>
 him. He guessed the poverty of his mother's home, kept together
on a<br>
 widow's pension of seven hundred francs a year--for the
education of<br>
 the son, who was just out of college, had absorbed all her
savings. He<br>
 therefore treated the youth almost paternally; often endeavoured
to<br>
 get him some fee from the Council, or paid it from his own
pocket. He<br>
 overwhelmed Sebastien with work, trained him, and allowed him to
do<br>
 the work of du Bruel's place, for which that vaudevillist,
otherwise<br>
 known as Cursy, paid him three hundred francs out of his salary.
In<br>
 the minds of Madame de la Roche and her son, Rabourdin was at
once a<br>
 great man, a tyrant, and an angel. On him all the poor fellow's
hopes<br>
 of getting an appointment depended, and the lad's devotion to
his<br>
 chief was boundless. He dined once a fortnight in the rue
Duphot; but<br>
 always at a family dinner, invited by Rabourdin himself; Madame
asked<br>
 him to evening parties only when she wanted partners.</p>

<p>At that moment Rabourdin was scolding poor Sebastien, the only
human<br>
 being who was in the secret of his immense labors. The youth
copied<br>
 and recopied the famous "statement," written on a hundred and
fifty<br>
 folio sheets, besides the corroborative documents, and the
summing up<br>
 (contained in one page), with the estimates bracketed, the
captions in<br>
 a running hand, and the sub-titles in a round one. Full of
enthusiasm,<br>
 in spite of his merely mechanical participation in the great
idea, the<br>
 lad of twenty would rewrite whole pages for a single blot, and
made it<br>
 his glory to touch up the writing, regarding it as the element
of a<br>
 noble undertaking. Sebastien had that afternoon committed the
great<br>
 imprudence of carrying into the general office, for the purpose
of<br>
 copying, a paper which contained the most dangerous facts to
make<br>
 known prematurely, namely, a memorandum relating to the
officials in<br>
 the central offices of all ministries, with facts concerning
their<br>
 fortunes, actual and prospective, together with the
individual<br>
 enterprises of each outside of his government employment.</p>

<p>All government clerks in Paris who are not endowed, like
Rabourdin,<br>
 with patriotic ambition or other marked capacity, usually add
the<br>
 profits of some industry to the salary of their office, in order
to<br>
 eke out a living. A number do as Monsieur Saillard did,--put
their<br>
 money into a business carried on by others, and spend their
evenings<br>
 in keeping the books of their associates. Many clerks are
married to<br>
 milliners, licensed tobacco dealers, women who have charge of
the<br>
 public lotteries or reading-rooms. Some, like the husband of
Madame<br>
 Colleville, Celestine's rival, play in the orchestra of a
theatre;<br>
 others like du Bruel, write vaudeville, comic operas,
melodramas, or<br>
 act as prompters behind the scenes. We may mention among them
Messrs.<br>
 Planard, Sewrin, etc. Pigault-Lebrun, Piis, Duvicquet, in their
day,<br>
 were in government employ. Monsieur Scribe's head-librarian was
a<br>
 clerk in the Treasury.</p>

<p>Besides such information as this, Rabourdin's memorandum
contained an<br>
 inquiry into the moral and physical capacities and faculties
necessary<br>
 in those who were to examine the intelligence, aptitude for
labor, and<br>
 sound health of the applicants for government
service,--three<br>
 indispensable qualities in men who are to bear the burden of
public<br>
 affairs and should do their business well and quickly. But
this<br>
 careful study, the result of ten years' observation and
experience,<br>
 and of a long acquaintance with men and things obtained by
intercourse<br>
 with the various functionaries in the different ministries,
would<br>
 assuredly have, to those who did not see its purport and
connection,<br>
 an air of treachery and police espial. If a single page of
these<br>
 papers were to fall under the eye of those concerned,
Monsieur<br>
 Rabourdin was lost. Sebastien, who admired his chief without<br>
 reservation, and who was, as yet, wholly ignorant of the evils
of<br>
 bureaucracy, had the follies of guilelessness as well as its
grace.<br>
 Blamed on a former occasion for carrying away these papers, he
now<br>
 bravely acknowledged his fault to its fullest extent; he related
how<br>
 he had put away both the memorandum and the copy carefully in a
box in<br>
 the office where no one would ever find them. Tears rolled from
his<br>
 eyes as he realized the greatness of his offence.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" said Rabourdin, kindly. "Don't be so imprudent
again,<br>
 but never mind now. Go to the office very early tomorrow
morning; here<br>
 is the key of a small safe which is in my roller secretary; it
shuts<br>
 with a combination lock. You can open it with the word 'sky';
put the<br>
 memorandum and your copy into it and shut it carefully."</p>

<p>This proof of confidence dried the poor fellow's tears.
Rabourdin<br>
 advised him to take a cup of tea and some cakes.</p>

<p>"Mamma forbids me to drink tea, on account of my chest,"
said<br>
 Sebastien.</p>

<p>"Well, then, my dear child," said the imposing Madame
Rabourdin, who<br>
 wished to appear gracious, "here are some sandwiches and cream;
come<br>
 and sit by me."</p>

<p>She made Sebastien sit down beside her, and the lad's heart
rose in<br>
 his throat as he felt the robe of this divinity brush the sleeve
of<br>
 his coat. Just then the beautiful woman caught sight of Monsieur
des<br>
 Lupeaulx standing in the doorway. She smiled, and not waiting
till he<br>
 came to her, she went to him.</p>

<p>"Why do you stay there as if you were sulking?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am not sulking," he returned; "I came to announce some good
news,<br>
 but the thought has overtaken me that it will only add to
your<br>
 severity towards me. I fancy myself six months hence almost a
stranger<br>
 to you. Yes, you are too clever, and I too experienced,--too
blase, if<br>
 you like,--for either of us to deceive the other. Your end is
attained<br>
 without its costing you more than a few smiles and gracious
words."</p>

<p>"Deceive each other! what can you mean?" she cried, in a hurt
tone.</p>

<p>"Yes; Monsieur de la Billardiere is dying, and from what the
minister<br>
 told me this evening I judge that your husband will be appointed
in<br>
 his place."</p>

<p>He thereupon related what he called his scene at the ministry
and the<br>
 jealousy of the countess, repeating her remarks about the
invitation<br>
 he had asked her to send to Madame Rabourdin.</p>

<p>"Monsieur des Lupeaulx," said Madame Rabourdin, with dignity,
"permit<br>
 me to tell you that my husband is the oldest head-clerk as well
as the<br>
 most capable man in the division; also that the appointment of
La<br>
 Billardiere over his head made much talk in the service, and
that my<br>
 husband has stayed on for the last year expecting this
promotion, for<br>
 which he has really no competitor and no rival."</p>

<p>"That is true."</p>

<p>"Well, then," she resumed, smiling and showing her handsome
teeth,<br>
 "how can you suppose that the friendship I feel for you is
marred by a<br>
 thought of self-interest? Why should you think me capable of
that?"</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx made a gesture of admiring denial.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she continued, "the heart of woman will always remain a
secret<br>
 for even the cleverest of men. Yes, I welcomed you to my house
with<br>
 the greatest pleasure; and there was, I admit, a motive of
self-<br>
 interest behind my pleasure--"</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"You have a career before you," she whispered in his ear, "a
future<br>
 without limit; you will be deputy, minister!" (What happiness
for an<br>
 ambitious man when such things as these are warbled in his ear
by the<br>
 sweet voice of a pretty woman!) "Oh, yes! I know you better than
you<br>
 know yourself. Rabourdin is a man who could be of immense
service to<br>
 you in such a career; he could do the steady work while you were
in<br>
 the Chamber. Just as you dream of the ministry, so I dream of
seeing<br>
 Rabourdin in the Council of State, and general director. It
is<br>
 therefore my object to draw together two men who can never
injure,<br>
 but, on the contrary, must greatly help each other. Isn't that
a<br>
 woman's mission? If you are friends, you will both rise the
faster,<br>
 and it is surely high time that each of you made hay. I have
burned my<br>
 ships," she added, smiling. "But you are not as frank with me as
I<br>
 have been with you."</p>

<p>"You would not listen to me if I were," he replied, with a
melancholy<br>
 air, in spite of the deep inward satisfaction her remarks gave
him.<br>
 "What would such future promotions avail me, if you dismiss me
now?"</p>

<p>"Before I listen to you," she replied, with naive Parisian
liveliness,<br>
 "we must be able to understand each other."</p>

<p>And she left the old fop to go and speak with Madame de
Chessel, a<br>
 countess from the provinces, who seemed about to take leave.</p>

<p>"That is a very extraordinary woman," said des Lupeaulx to
himself. "I<br>
 don't know my own self when I am with her."</p>

<p>Accordingly, this man of no principle, who six years earlier
had kept<br>
 a ballet-girl, and who now, thanks to his position, made himself
a<br>
 seraglio with the pretty wives of the under-clerks, and lived in
the<br>
 world of journalists and actresses, became devotedly attentive
all the<br>
 evening to Celestine, and was the last to leave the house.</p>

<p>"At last!" thought Madame Rabourdin, as she undressed that
night, "we<br>
 have the place! Twelve thousand francs a year and perquisites,
beside<br>
 the rents of our farms at Grajeux,--nearly twenty thousand
francs a<br>
 year. It is not affluence, but at least it isn't poverty."</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h4>THREE-QUARTER LENGTH PORTRAITS OF CERTAIN GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS</h4>

<p>If it were possible for literature to use the microscope of
the<br>
 Leuwenhoeks, the Malpighis, and the Raspails (an attempt once
made by<br>
 Hoffman, of Berlin), and if we could magnify and then picture
the<br>
 teredos navalis, in other words, those ship-worms which
brought<br>
 Holland within an inch of collapsing by honey-combing her dykes,
we<br>
 might have been able to give a more distinct idea of
Messieurs<br>
 Gigonnet, Baudoyer, Saillard, Gaudron, Falleix, Transon, Godard
and<br>
 company, borers and burrowers, who proved their undermining
power in<br>
 the thirtieth year of this century.</p>

<p><br>
 But now it is time to show another set of teredos, who burrowed
and<br>
 swarmed in the government offices where the principal scenes of
our<br>
 present study took place.</p>

<p>In Paris nearly all these government bureaus resemble each
other. Into<br>
 whatever ministry you penetrate to ask some slight favor, or to
get<br>
 redress for a trifling wrong, you will find the same dark
corridors,<br>
 ill-lighted stairways, doors with oval panes of glass like eyes,
as at<br>
 the theatre. In the first room as you enter you will find the
office<br>
 servant; in the second, the under-clerks; the private office of
the<br>
 second head-clerk is to the right or left, and further on is
that of<br>
 the head of the bureau. As to the important personage called,
under<br>
 the Empire, head of division, then, under the Restoration,
director,<br>
 and now by the former name, head or chief of division, he lives
either<br>
 above or below the offices of his three or four different
bureaus.</p>

<p>Speaking in the administrative sense, a bureau consists of a
man-<br>
 servant, several supernumeraries (who do the work gratis for a
certain<br>
 number of years), various copying clerks, writers of bills and
deeds,<br>
 order clerks, principal clerks, second or under head-clerk, and
head-<br>
 clerk, otherwise called head or chief of the bureau. These<br>
 denominational titles vary under some administrations; for
instance,<br>
 the order-clerks are sometimes called auditors, or again,
book-<br>
 keepers.</p>

<p>Paved like the corridor, and hung with a shabby paper, the
first room,<br>
 where the servant is stationed, is furnished with a stove, a
large<br>
 black table with inkstand, pens, and paper, and benches, but no
mats<br>
 on which to wipe the public feet. The clerk's office beyond is a
large<br>
 room, tolerably well lighted, but seldom floored with wood.
Wooden<br>
 floors and fireplaces are commonly kept sacred to heads of
bureaus and<br>
 divisions; and so are closets, wardrobes, mahogany tables, sofas
and<br>
 armchairs covered with red or green morocco, silk curtains, and
other<br>
 articles of administrative luxury. The clerk's office contents
itself<br>
 with a stove, the pipe of which goes into the chimney, if there
be a<br>
 chimney. The wall paper is plain and all of one color, usually
green<br>
 or brown. The tables are of black wood. The private
characteristics of<br>
 the several clerks often crop out in their method of
settling<br>
 themselves at their desks,--the chilly one has a wooden
footstool<br>
 under his feet; the man with a bilious temperament has a metal
mat;<br>
 the lymphatic being who dreads draughts constructs a
fortification of<br>
 boxes on a screen. The door of the under-head-clerk's office
always<br>
 stands open so that he may keep an eye to some extent on his<br>
 subordinates.</p>

<p>Perhaps an exact description of Monsieur de la Billardiere's
division<br>
 will suffice to give foreigners and provincials an idea of
the<br>
 internal manners and customs of a government office; the
chief<br>
 features of which are probably much the same in the civil
service of<br>
 all European governments.</p>

<p>In the first place, picture to yourself the man who is thus
described<br>
 in the Yearly Register:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Chief of Division.--Monsieur la baron Flamet de la
Billardiere<br>
 (Athanase-Jean-Francois-Michel) formerly provost-marshal of
the<br>
 department of the Correze, gentleman in ordinary of the bed-<br>
 chamber, president of the college of the department of the<br>
 Dordogne, officer of the Legion of honor, knight of Saint
Louis<br>
 and of the foreign orders of Christ, Isabella, Saint
Wladimir,<br>
 etc., member of the Academy of Gers, and other learned
bodies,<br>
 vice-president of the Society of Belles-lettres, member of
the<br>
 Association of Saint-Joseph and of the Society of Prisons, one
of<br>
 the mayors of Paris, etc."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The person who requires so much typographic space was at this
time<br>
 occupying an area five feet six in length by thirty-six inches
in<br>
 width in a bed, his head adorned with a cotton night-cap tied on
by<br>
 flame-colored ribbons; attended by Despleins, the King's
surgeon, and<br>
 young doctor Bianchon, flanked by two old female relatives,
surrounded<br>
 by phials of all kinds, bandages, appliances, and various
mortuary<br>
 instruments, and watched over by the curate of Saint-Roch, who
was<br>
 advising him to think of his salvation.</p>

<p><br>
 La Billardiere's division occupied the upper floor of a
magnificent<br>
 mansion, in which the vast official ocean of a ministry was
contained.<br>
 A wide landing separated its two bureaus, the doors of which
were duly<br>
 labelled. The private offices and antechambers of the heads of
the two<br>
 bureaus, Monsieur Rabourdin and Monsieur Baudoyer, were below on
the<br>
 second floor, and beyond that of Monsieur Rabourdin were the<br>
 antechamber, salon, and two offices of Monsieur de la
Billardiere.</p>

<p>On the first floor, divided in two by an entresol, were the
living<br>
 rooms and office of Monsieur Ernest de la Briere, an occult
and<br>
 powerful personage who must be described in a few words, for he
well<br>
 deserves the parenthesis. This young man held, during the whole
time<br>
 that this particular administration lasted, the position of
private<br>
 secretary to the minister. His apartment was connected by a
secret<br>
 door with the private office of his Excellency. A private
secretary is<br>
 to the minister himself what des Lupeaulx was to the ministry
at<br>
 large. The same difference existed between young La Briere and
des<br>
 Lupeaulx that there is between an aide-de-camp and a chief of
staff.<br>
 This ministerial apprentice decamps when his protector leaves
office,<br>
 returning sometimes when he returns. If the minister enjoys the
royal<br>
 favor when he falls, or still has parliamentary hopes, he takes
his<br>
 secretary with him into retirement only to bring him back on
his<br>
 return; otherwise he puts him to grass in some of the
various<br>
 administrative pastures,--for instance, in the Court of
Exchequer,<br>
 that wayside refuge where private secretaries wait for the storm
to<br>
 blow over. The young man is not precisely a government official;
he is<br>
 a political character, however; and sometimes his politics are
limited<br>
 to those of one man. When we think of the number of letters it
is the<br>
 private secretary's fate to open and read, besides all his
other<br>
 avocations, it is very evident that under a monarchical
government his<br>
 services would be well paid for. A drudge of this kind costs ten
or<br>
 twenty thousand francs a year; and he enjoys, moreover, the
opera-<br>
 boxes, the social invitations, and the carriages of the
minister. The<br>
 Emperor of Russia would be thankful to be able to pay fifty
thousand a<br>
 year to one of these amiable constitutional poodles, so gentle,
so<br>
 nicely curled, so caressing, so docile, always spick and
span,--<br>
 careful watch-dogs besides, and faithful to a degree! But the
private<br>
 secretary is a product of the representative government
hot-house; he<br>
 is propagated and developed there, and there only. Under a
monarchy<br>
 you will find none but courtiers and vassals, whereas under
a<br>
 constitutional government you may be flattered, served, and
adulated<br>
 by free men. In France ministers are better off than kings or
women;<br>
 they have some one who thoroughly understands them. Perhaps,
indeed,<br>
 the private secretary is to be pitied as much as women and
white<br>
 paper. They are nonentities who are made to bear all things.
They are<br>
 allowed no talents except hidden ones, which must be employed in
the<br>
 service of their ministers. A public show of talent would ruin
them.<br>
 The private secretary is therefore an intimate friend in the
gift of<br>
 government-- However, let us return to the bureaus.</p>

<p>Three men-servants lived in peace in the Billardiere division,
to wit:<br>
 a footman for the two bureaus, another for the service of the
two<br>
 chiefs, and a third for the director of the division himself.
All<br>
 three were lodged, warmed, and clothed by the State, and wore
the<br>
 well-known livery of the State, blue coat with red pipings
for<br>
 undress, and broad red, white, and blue braid for great
occasions. La<br>
 Billardiere's man had the air of a gentleman-usher, an
innovation<br>
 which gave an aspect of dignity to the division.</p>

<p>Pillars of the ministry, experts in all manners and
customs<br>
 bureaucratic, well-warmed and clothed at the State's expense,
growing<br>
 rich by reason of their few wants, these lackeys saw
completely<br>
 through the government officials, collectively and individually.
They<br>
 had no better way of amusing their idle hours than by observing
these<br>
 personages and studying their peculiarities. They knew how far
to<br>
 trust the clerks with loans of money, doing their various
commissions<br>
 with absolute discretion; they pawned and took out of pawn,
bought up<br>
 bills when due, and lent money without interest, albeit no clerk
ever<br>
 borrowed of them without returning a "gratification." These
servants<br>
 without a master received a salary of nine hundred francs a
year; new<br>
 years' gifts and "gratifications" brought their emoluments to
twelve<br>
 hundred francs, and they made almost as much money by
serving<br>
 breakfasts to the clerks at the office.</p>

<p>The elder of these men, who was also the richest, waited upon
the main<br>
 body of the clerks. He was sixty years of age, with white hair
cropped<br>
 short like a brush; stout, thickset, and apoplectic about the
neck,<br>
 with a vulgar pimpled face, gray eyes, and a mouth like a
furnace<br>
 door; such was the profile portrait of Antoine, the oldest
attendant<br>
 in the ministry. He had brought his two nephews, Laurent and
Gabriel,<br>
 from Echelles in Savoie,--one to serve the heads of the bureaus,
the<br>
 other the director himself. All three came to open the offices
and<br>
 clean them, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; at
which<br>
 time they read the newspapers and talked civil service politics
from<br>
 their point of view with the servants of other divisions,
exchanging<br>
 the bureaucratic gossip. In common with servants of modern
houses who<br>
 know their masters' private affairs thoroughly, they lived at
the<br>
 ministry like spiders at the centre of a web, where they felt
the<br>
 slightest jar of the fabric.</p>

<p>On a Thursday evening, the day after the ministerial reception
and<br>
 Madame Rabourdin's evening party, just as Antoine was trimming
his<br>
 beard and his nephews were assisting him in the antechamber of
the<br>
 division on the upper floor, they were surprised by the
unexpected<br>
 arrival of one of the clerks.</p>

<p>"That's Monsieur Dutocq," said Antoine. "I know him by that
pickpocket<br>
 step of his. He is always moving round on the sly, that man. He
is on<br>
 your back before you know it. Yesterday, contrary to his usual
ways,<br>
 he outstayed the last man in the office; such a thing hasn't
happened<br>
 three times since he has been at the ministry."</p>

<p>Here follows the portrait of Monsieur Dutocq, order-clerk in
the<br>
 Rabourdin bureau: Thirty-eight years old, oblong face and
bilious<br>
 skin, grizzled hair always cut close, low forehead, heavy
eyebrows<br>
 meeting together, a crooked nose and pinched lips; tall, the
right<br>
 shoulder slightly higher than the left; brown coat, black
waistcoat,<br>
 silk cravat, yellowish trousers, black woollen stockings, and
shoes<br>
 with flapping bows; thus you behold him. Idle and incapable, he
hated<br>
 Rabourdin,--naturally enough, for Rabourdin had no vice to
flatter,<br>
 and no bad or weak side on which Dutocq could make himself
useful. Far<br>
 too noble to injure a clerk, the chief was also too
clear-sighted to<br>
 be deceived by any make-believe. Dutocq kept his place
therefore<br>
 solely through Rabourdin's generosity, and was very certain that
he<br>
 could never be promoted if the latter succeeded La Billardiere.
Though<br>
 he knew himself incapable of important work, Dutocq was well
aware<br>
 that in a government office incapacity was no hindrance to<br>
 advancement; La Billardiere's own appointment over the head of
so<br>
 capable a man as Rabourdin had been a striking and fatal example
of<br>
 this. Wickedness combined with self-interest works with a
power<br>
 equivalent to that of intellect; evilly disposed and wholly
self-<br>
 interested, Dutocq had endeavoured to strengthen his position
by<br>
 becoming a spy in all the offices. After 1816 he assumed a
marked<br>
 religious tone, foreseeing the favor which the fools of those
days<br>
 would bestow on those they indiscriminately called Jesuits.
Belonging<br>
 to that fraternity in spirit, though not admitted to its rites,
Dutocq<br>
 went from bureau to bureau, sounded consciences by recounting
immoral<br>
 jests, and then reported and paraphrased results to des
Lupeaulx; the<br>
 latter thus learned all the trivial events of the ministry, and
often<br>
 surprised the minister by his consummate knowledge of what was
going<br>
 on. He tolerated Dutocq under the idea that circumstances might
some<br>
 day make him useful, were it only to get him or some
distinguished<br>
 friend of his out of a scrape by a disgraceful marriage. The
two<br>
 understood each other well. Dutocq had succeeded Monsieur Poiret
the<br>
 elder, who had retired in 1814, and now lived in the pension
Vanquer<br>
 in the Latin quarter. Dutocq himself lived in a pension in the
rue de<br>
 Beaune, and spent his evenings in the Palais-Royal, sometimes
going to<br>
 the theatre, thanks to du Bruel, who gave him an author's ticket
about<br>
 once a week. And now, a word on du Bruel.</p>

<p>Though Sebastien did his work at the office for the small
compensation<br>
 we have mentioned, du Bruel was in the habit of coming there
to<br>
 advertise the fact that he was the under-head-clerk and to draw
his<br>
 salary. His real work was that of dramatic critic to a
leading<br>
 ministerial journal, in which he also wrote articles inspired by
the<br>
 ministers,--a very well understood, clearly defined, and
quite<br>
 unassailable position. Du Bruel was not lacking in those
diplomatic<br>
 little tricks which go so far to conciliate general good-will.
He sent<br>
 Madame Rabourdin an opera-box for a first representation, took
her<br>
 there in a carriage and brought her back,--an attention
which<br>
 evidently pleased her. Rabourdin, who was never exacting with
his<br>
 subordinates allowed du Bruel to go off to rehearsals, come to
the<br>
 office at his own hours, and work at his vaudevilles when
there.<br>
 Monsieur le Duc de Chaulieu, the minister, knew that du Bruel
was<br>
 writing a novel which was to be dedicated to himself. Dressed
with the<br>
 careless ease of a theatre man, du Bruel wore, in the
morning,<br>
 trousers strapped under his feet, shoes with gaiters, a
waistcoat<br>
 evidently vamped over, an olive surtout, and a black cravat. At
night<br>
 he played the gentleman in elegant clothes. He lived, for
good<br>
 reasons, in the same house as Florine, an actress for whom he
wrote<br>
 plays. Du Bruel, or to give him his pen name, Cursy, was working
just<br>
 now at a piece in five acts for the Francais. Sebastien was
devoted to<br>
 the author,--who occasionally gave him tickets to the
pit,--and<br>
 applauded his pieces at the parts which du Bruel told him were
of<br>
 doubtful interest, with all the faith and enthusiasm of his
years. In<br>
 fact, the youth looked upon the playwright as a great author,
and it<br>
 was to Sebastien that du Bruel said, the day after a first<br>
 representation of a vaudeville produced, like all vaudevilles,
by<br>
 three collaborators, "The audience preferred the scenes written
by<br>
 two."</p>

<p>"Why don't you write alone?" asked Sebastien naively.</p>

<p>There were good reasons why du Bruel did not write alone. He
was the<br>
 third of an author. A dramatic writer, as few people know, is
made up<br>
 of three individuals; first, the man with brains who invents
the<br>
 subject and maps out the structure, or scenario, of the
vaudeville;<br>
 second, the plodder, who works the piece into shape; and third,
the<br>
 toucher-up, who sets the songs to music, arranges the chorus
and<br>
 concerted pieces and fits them into their right place, and
finally<br>
 writes the puffs and advertisements. Du Bruel was a plodder; at
the<br>
 office he read the newest books, extracted their wit, and laid
it by<br>
 for use in his dialogues. He was liked by his collaborators on
account<br>
 of his carefulness; the man with brains, sure of being
understood,<br>
 could cross his arms and feel that his ideas would be well
rendered.<br>
 The clerks in the office liked their companion well enough to
attend a<br>
 first performance of his plays in a body and applaud them, for
he<br>
 really deserved the title of a good fellow. His hand went
readily to<br>
 his pocket; ices and punch were bestowed without prodding, and
he<br>
 loaned fifty francs without asking them back. He owned a
country-house<br>
 at Aulnay, laid by his money, and had, besides the four thousand
five<br>
 hundred francs of his salary under government, twelve hundred
francs<br>
 pension from the civil list, and eight hundred from the three
hundred<br>
 thousand francs fund voted by the Chambers for encouragement of
the<br>
 Arts. Add to these diverse emoluments nine thousand francs
earned by<br>
 his quarters, thirds, and halves of plays in three different
theatres,<br>
 and you will readily understand that such a man must be
physically<br>
 round, fat, and comfortable, with the face of a worthy
capitalist. As<br>
 to morals, he was the lover and the beloved of Tullia and felt
himself<br>
 preferred in heart to the brilliant Duc de Rhetore, the lover
in<br>
 chief.</p>

<p>Dutocq had seen with great uneasiness what he called the
liaison of<br>
 des Lupeaulx with Madame Rabourdin, and his silent wrath on
the<br>
 subject was accumulating. He had too prying an eye not to have
guessed<br>
 that Rabourdin was engaged in some great work outside of his
official<br>
 labors, and he was provoked to feel that he knew nothing about
it,<br>
 whereas that little Sebastien was, wholly or in part, in the
secret.<br>
 Dutocq was intimate with Godard, under-head-clerk to Baudoyer,
and the<br>
 high esteem in which Dutocq held Baudoyer was the original cause
of<br>
 his acquaintance with Godard; not that Dutocq was sincere even
in<br>
 this; but by praising Baudoyer and saying nothing of Rabourdin
he<br>
 satisfied his hatred after the fashion of little minds.</p>

<p>Joseph Godard, a cousin of Mitral on the mother's side,
made<br>
 pretension to the hand of Mademoiselle Baudoyer, not perceiving
that<br>
 her mother was laying siege to Falliex as a son-in-law. He
brought<br>
 little gifts to the young lady, artificial flowers, bonbons on
New-<br>
 Year's day and pretty boxes for her birthday. Twenty-six years
of age,<br>
 a worker working without purpose, steady as a girl, monotonous
and<br>
 apathetic, holding cafes, cigars, and horsemanship in
detestation,<br>
 going to bed regularly at ten o'clock and rising at seven,
gifted with<br>
 some social talents, such as playing quadrille music on the
flute,<br>
 which first brought him into favor with the Saillards and
the<br>
 Baudoyers. He was moreover a fifer in the National Guard,--to
escape<br>
 his turn of sitting up all night in a barrack-room. Godard was
devoted<br>
 more especially to natural history. He made collections of
shells and<br>
 minerals, knew how to stuff birds, kept a mass of curiosities
bought<br>
 for nothing in his bedroom; took possession of phials and
empty<br>
 perfume bottles for his specimens; pinned butterflies and
beetles<br>
 under glass, hung Chinese parasols on the walls, together with
dried<br>
 fishskins. He lived with his sister, an artificial-flower maker,
in<br>
 the due de Richelieu. Though much admired by mammas this model
young<br>
 man was looked down upon by his sister's shop-girls, who had
tried to<br>
 inveigle him. Slim and lean, of medium height, with dark circles
round<br>
 his eyes, Joseph Godard took little care of his person; his
clothes<br>
 were ill-cut, his trousers bagged, he wore white stockings at
all<br>
 seasons of the year, a hat with a narrow brim and laced shoes.
He was<br>
 always complaining of his digestion. His principal vice was a
mania<br>
 for proposing rural parties during the summer season, excursions
to<br>
 Montmorency, picnics on the grass, and visits to creameries on
the<br>
 boulevard du Mont-Parnasse. For the last six months Dutocq had
taken<br>
 to visiting Mademoiselle Godard from time to time, with certain
views<br>
 of his own, hoping to discover in her establishment some
female<br>
 treasure.</p>

<p>Thus Baudoyer had a pair of henchmen in Dutocq and Godard.
Monsieur<br>
 Saillard, too innocent to judge rightly of Dutocq, was in the
habit of<br>
 paying him frequent little visits at the office. Young La
Billardiere,<br>
 the director's son, placed as supernumerary with Baudoyer,
made<br>
 another member of the clique. The clever heads in the offices
laughed<br>
 much at this alliance of incapables. Bixiou named Baudoyer,
Godard,<br>
 and Dutocq a "Trinity without the Spirit," and little La
Billardiere<br>
 the "Pascal Lamb."</p>

<p>"You are early this morning," said Antoine to Dutocq,
laughing.</p>

<p>"So are you, Antoine," answered Dutocq; "you see, the
newspapers do<br>
 come earlier than you let us have them at the office."</p>

<p>"They did to-day, by chance," replied Antoine, not
disconcerted; "they<br>
 never come two days together at the same hour."</p>

<p>The two nephews looked at each other as if to say, in
admiration of<br>
 their uncle, "What cheek he has!"</p>

<p>"Though I make two sous by all his breakfasts," muttered
Antoine, as<br>
 he heard Monsieur Dutocq close the office door, "I'd give them
up to<br>
 get that man out of our division."</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur Sebastien, you are not the first here to-day,"
said<br>
 Antoine, a quarter of an hour later, to the supernumerary.</p>

<p>"Who is here?" asked the poor lad, turning pale.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Dutocq," answered Laurent.</p>

<p>Virgin natures have, beyond all others, the inexplicable gift
of<br>
 second-sight, the reason of which lies perhaps in the purity of
their<br>
 nervous systems, which are, as it were, brand-new. Sebastien had
long<br>
 guessed Dutocq's hatred to his revered Rabourdin. So that when
Laurent<br>
 uttered his name a dreadful presentiment took possession of the
lad's<br>
 mind, and crying out, "I feared it!" he flew like an arrow into
the<br>
 corridor.</p>

<p>"There is going to be a row in the division," said Antoine,
shaking<br>
 his white head as he put on his livery. "It is very certain
that<br>
 Monsieur le baron is off to his account. Yes, Madame Gruget,
the<br>
 nurse, told me he couldn't live through the day. What a stir
there'll<br>
 be! oh! won't there! Go along, you fellows, and see if the
stoves are<br>
 drawing properly. Heavens and earth! our world is coming down
about<br>
 our ears."</p>

<p>"That poor young one," said Laurent, "had a sort of sunstroke
when he<br>
 heard that Jesuit of a Dutocq had got here before him."</p>

<p>"I have told him a dozen times,--for after all one ought to
tell the<br>
 truth to an honest clerk, and what I call an honest clerk is one
like<br>
 that little fellow who gives us "recta" his ten francs on
New-Year's<br>
 day,--I have said to him again and again: The more you work the
more<br>
 they'll make you work, and they won't promote you. He doesn't
listen<br>
 to me; he tires himself out staying here till five o'clock, an
hour<br>
 after all the others have gone. Folly! he'll never get on that
way!<br>
 The proof is that not a word has been said about giving him
an<br>
 appointment, though he has been here two years. It's a shame! it
makes<br>
 my blood boil."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Rabourdin is very fond of Monsieur Sebastien," said
Laurent.</p>

<p>"But Monsieur Rabourdin isn't a minister," retorted Antoine;
"it will<br>
 be a hot day when that happens, and the hens will have teeth; he
is<br>
 too--but mum! When I think that I carry salaries to those
humbugs who<br>
 stay away and do as they please, while that poor little La Roche
works<br>
 himself to death, I ask myself if God ever thinks of the
civil<br>
 service. And what do they give you, these pets of Monsieur le
marechal<br>
 and Monsieur le duc? 'Thank you, my dear Antoine, thank you,'
with a<br>
 gracious nod! Pack of sluggards! go to work, or you'll bring
another<br>
 revolution about your ears. Didn't see such goings-on under
Monsieur<br>
 Robert Lindet. I know, for I served my apprenticeship under
Robert<br>
 Lindet. The clerks had to work in his day! You ought to have
seen how<br>
 they scratched paper here till midnight; why, the stoves went
out and<br>
 nobody noticed it. It was all because the guillotine was there!
now-a-<br>
 days they only mark 'em when they come in late!"</p>

<p>"Uncle Antoine," said Gabriel, "as you are so talkative this
morning,<br>
 just tell us what you think a clerk really ought to be."</p>

<p>"A government clerk," replied Antoine, gravely, "is a man who
sits in<br>
 a government office and writes. But there, there, what am I
talking<br>
 about? Without the clerks, where should we be, I'd like to know?
Go<br>
 along and look after your stoves and mind you never say harm of
a<br>
 government clerk, you fellows. Gabriel, the stove in the large
office<br>
 draws like the devil; you must turn the damper."</p>

<p>Antoine stationed himself at a corner of the landing whence he
could<br>
 see all the officials as they entered the porte-cochere; he knew
every<br>
 one at the ministry, and watched their behavior, observing
narrowly<br>
 the contrasts in their dress and appearance.</p>

<p>The first to arrive after Sebastien was a clerk of deeds
in<br>
 Rabourdin's office named Phellion, a respectable family-man. To
the<br>
 influence of his chief he owed a half-scholarship for each of
his two<br>
 sons in the College Henri IV.; while his daughter was being
educated<br>
 gratis at a boarding school where his wife gave music lessons
and he<br>
 himself a course of history and one of geography in the
evenings. He<br>
 was about forty-five years of age, sergeant-major of his company
in<br>
 the National Guard, very compassionate in feeling and words,
but<br>
 wholly unable to give away a penny. Proud of his post, however,
and<br>
 satisfied with his lot, he applied himself faithfully to serve
the<br>
 government, believed he was useful to his country, and boasted
of his<br>
 indifference to politics, knowing none but those of the men in
power.<br>
 Monsieur Rabourdin pleased him highly whenever he asked him to
stay<br>
 half an hour longer to finish a piece of work. On such occasions
he<br>
 would say, when he reached home, "Public affairs detained me;
when a<br>
 man belongs to the government he is no longer master of
himself." He<br>
 compiled books of questions and answers on various studies for
the use<br>
 of young ladies in boarding-schools. These little "solid
treatises,"<br>
 as he called them, were sold at the University library under the
name<br>
 of "Historical and Geographic Catechisms." Feeling himself in
duty<br>
 bound to offer a copy of each volume, bound in red morocco,
to<br>
 Monsieur Rabourdin, he always came in full dress to present
them,--<br>
 breeches and silk stockings, and shoes with gold buckles.
Monsieur<br>
 Phellion received his friends on Thursday evenings, on which
occasions<br>
 the company played bouillote, at five sous a game, and were
regaled<br>
 with cakes and beer. He had never yet dared to invite
Monsieur<br>
 Rabourdin to honor him with his presence, though he would
have<br>
 regarded such an event as the most distinguished of his life. He
said<br>
 if he could leave one of his sons following in the steps of
Monsieur<br>
 Rabourdin he should die the happiest father in the world.</p>

<p>One of his greatest pleasures was to explore the environs of
Paris,<br>
 which he did with a map. He knew every inch of Arcueil,
Bievre,<br>
 Fontenay-aux-Roses, and Aulnay, so famous as the resort of
great<br>
 writers, and hoped in time to know the whole western side of
the<br>
 country around Paris. He intended to put his eldest son into
a<br>
 government office and his second into the Ecole Polytechnique.
He<br>
 often said to the elder, "When you have the honor to be a
government<br>
 clerk"; though he suspected him of a preference for the exact
sciences<br>
 and did his best to repress it, mentally resolved to abandon the
lad<br>
 to his own devices if he persisted. When Rabourdin sent for him
to<br>
 come down and receive instructions about some particular piece
of<br>
 work, Phellion gave all his mind to it,--listening to every word
the<br>
 chief said, as a dilettante listens to an air at the Opera.
Silent in<br>
 the office, with his feet in the air resting on a wooden desk,
and<br>
 never moving them, he studied his task conscientiously. His
official<br>
 letters were written with the utmost gravity, and transmitted
the<br>
 commands of the minister in solemn phrases. Monsieur Phellion's
face<br>
 was that of a pensive ram, with little color and pitted by the
small-<br>
 pox; the lips were thick and the lower one pendent; the eyes
light-<br>
 blue, and his figure above the common height. Neat and clean as
a<br>
 master of history and geography in a young ladies' school ought
to be,<br>
 he wore fine linen, a pleated shirt-frill, a black cashmere
waistcoat,<br>
 left open and showing a pair of braces embroidered by his
daughter, a<br>
 diamond in the bosom of his shirt, a black coat, and blue
trousers. In<br>
 winter he added a nut-colored box-coat with three capes, and
carried a<br>
 loaded stick, necessitated, he said, by the profound solitude of
the<br>
 quarter in which he lived. He had given up taking snuff, and
referred<br>
 to this reform as a striking example of the empire a man
could<br>
 exercise over himself. Monsieur Phellion came slowly up the
stairs,<br>
 for he was afraid of asthma, having what he called an "adipose
chest."<br>
 He saluted Antoine with dignity.</p>

<p><br>
 The next to follow was a copying-clerk, who presented a
strange<br>
 contrast to the virtuous Phellion. Vimeux was a young man of
twenty-<br>
 five, with a salary of fifteen hundred francs, well-made and
graceful,<br>
 with a romantic face, and eyes, hair, beard, and eyebrows as
black as<br>
 jet, fine teeth, charming hands, and wearing a moustache so
carefully<br>
 trimmed that he seemed to have made it the business and
occupation of<br>
 his life. Vimeux had such aptitude for work that he despatched
it much<br>
 quicker than any of the other clerks. "He has a gift, that young
man!"<br>
 Phellion said of him when he saw him cross his legs and have
nothing<br>
 to do for the rest of the day, having got through his appointed
task;<br>
 "and see what a little dandy he is!" Vimeux breakfasted on a
roll and<br>
 a glass of water, dined for twenty sous at Katcomb's, and lodged
in a<br>
 furnished room, for which he paid twelve francs a month. His<br>
 happiness, his sole pleasure in life, was dress. He ruined
himself in<br>
 miraculous waistcoats, in trousers that were tight,
half-tight,<br>
 pleated, or embroidered; in superfine boots, well-made coats
which<br>
 outlined his elegant figure; in bewitching collars, spotless
gloves,<br>
 and immaculate hats. A ring with a coat of arms adorned his
hand,<br>
 outside his glove, from which dangled a handsome cane; with
these<br>
 accessories he endeavoured to assume the air and manner of a
wealthy<br>
 young man. After the office closed he appeared in the great walk
of<br>
 the Tuileries, with a tooth-pick in his mouth, as though he were
a<br>
 millionaire who had just dined. Always on the lookout for a
woman,--an<br>
 Englishwoman, a foreigner of some kind, or a widow,--who might
fall in<br>
 love with him, he practised the art of twirling his cane and
of<br>
 flinging the sort of glance which Bixiou told him was American.
He<br>
 smiled to show his fine teeth; he wore no socks under his boots,
but<br>
 he had his hair curled every day. Vimeux was prepared, in
accordance<br>
 with fixed principles, to marry a hunch-back with six thousand a
year,<br>
 or a woman of forty-five at eight thousand, or an Englishwoman
for<br>
 half that sum. Phellion, who delighted in his neat hand-writing,
and<br>
 was full of compassion for the fellow, read him lectures on the
duty<br>
 of giving lessons in penmanship,--an honorable career, he said,
which<br>
 would ameliorate existence and even render it agreeable; he
promised<br>
 him a situation in a young ladies' boarding-school. But Vimeux's
head<br>
 was so full of his own idea that no human being could prevent
him from<br>
 having faith in his star. He continued to lay himself out, like
a<br>
 salmon at a fishmonger's, in spite of his empty stomach and the
fact<br>
 that he had fruitlessly exhibited his enormous moustache and his
fine<br>
 clothes for over three years. As he owed Antoine more than
thirty<br>
 francs for his breakfasts, he lowered his eyes every time he
passed<br>
 him; and yet he never failed at midday to ask the man to buy him
a<br>
 roll.</p>

<p>After trying to get a few reasonable ideas into this foolish
head,<br>
 Rabourdin had finally given up the attempt as hopeless. Adolphe
(his<br>
 family name was Adolphe) had lately economized on dinners and
lived<br>
 entirely on bread and water, to buy a pair of spurs and a
riding-whip.<br>
 Jokes at the expense of this starving Amadis were made only in
the<br>
 spirit of mischievous fun which creates vaudevilles, for he was
really<br>
 a kind-hearted fellow and a good comrade, who harmed no one
but<br>
 himself. A standing joke in the two bureaus was the question
whether<br>
 he wore corsets, and bets depended on it. Vimeux was
originally<br>
 appointed to Baudoyer's bureau, but he manoeuvred to get
himself<br>
 transferred to Rabourdin's, on account of Baudoyer's extreme
severity<br>
 in relation to what were called "the English,"--a name given by
the<br>
 government clerks to their creditors. "English day" means the
day on<br>
 which the government offices are thrown open to the public.
Certain<br>
 then of finding their delinquent debtors, the creditors swarm in
and<br>
 torment them, asking when they intend to pay, and threatening
to<br>
 attach their salaries. The implacable Baudoyer compelled the
clerks to<br>
 remain at their desks and endure this torture. "It was their
place not<br>
 to make debts," he said; and he considered his severity as a
duty<br>
 which he owed to the public weal. Rabourdin, on the
contrary,<br>
 protected the clerks against their creditors, and turned the
latter<br>
 away, saying that the government bureaus were open for
public<br>
 business, not private. Much ridicule pursued Vimeux in both
bureaus<br>
 when the clank of his spurs resounded in the corridors and on
the<br>
 staircases. The wag of the ministry, Bixiou, sent round a
paper,<br>
 headed by a caricature of his victim on a pasteboard horse,
asking for<br>
 subscriptions to buy him a live charger. Monsieur Baudoyer was
down<br>
 for a bale of hay taken from his own forage allowance, and each
of the<br>
 clerks wrote his little epigram; Vimeux himself, good-natured
fellow<br>
 that he was, subscribed under the name of "Miss Fairfax."</p>

<p>Handsome clerks of the Vimeux style have their salaries on
which to<br>
 live, and their good looks by which to make their fortune.
Devoted to<br>
 masked balls during the carnival, they seek their luck there,
though<br>
 it often escapes them. Many end the weary round by marrying
milliners,<br>
 or old women,--sometimes, however, young ones who are charmed
with<br>
 their handsome persons, and with whom they set up a romance<br>
 illustrated with stupid love letters, which, nevertheless, seem
to<br>
 answer their purpose.</p>

<p>Bixiou (pronounce it Bisiou) was a draughtsman, who ridiculed
Dutocq<br>
 as readily as he did Rabourdin, whom he nicknamed "the
virtuous<br>
 woman." Without doubt the cleverest man in the division or even
in the<br>
 ministry (but clever after the fashion of a monkey, without aim
or<br>
 sequence), Bixiou was so essentially useful to Baudoyer and
Godard<br>
 that they upheld and protected him in spite of his misconduct;
for he<br>
 did their work when they were incapable of doing it for
themselves.<br>
 Bixiou wanted either Godard's or du Bruel's place as
under-head-clerk,<br>
 but his conduct interfered with his promotion. Sometimes he
sneered at<br>
 the public service; this was usually after he had made some
happy hit,<br>
 such as the publication of portraits in the famous Fualdes case
(for<br>
 which he drew faces hap-hazard), or his sketch of the debate on
the<br>
 Castaing affair. At other times, when possessed with a desire to
get<br>
 on, he really applied himself to work, though he would soon
leave off<br>
 to write a vaudeville, which was never finished. A thorough
egoist, a<br>
 spendthrift and a miser in one,--that is to say, spending his
money<br>
 solely on himself,--sharp, aggressive, and indiscreet, he did
mischief<br>
 for mischief's sake; above all, he attacked the weak,
respected<br>
 nothing and believed in nothing, neither in France, nor in God,
nor in<br>
 art, nor in the Greeks, nor in the Turks, nor in the
monarchy,--<br>
 insulting and disparaging everything that he could not
comprehend. He<br>
 was the first to paint a black cap on Charles X.'s head on the
five-<br>
 franc coins. He mimicked Dr. Gall when lecturing, till he made
the<br>
 most starched of diplomatists burst their buttons. Famous for
his<br>
 practical jokes, he varied them with such elaborate care that
he<br>
 always obtained a victim. His great secret in this was the power
of<br>
 guessing the inmost wishes of others; he knew the way to many a
castle<br>
 in the air, to the dreams about which a man may be fooled
because he<br>
 wants to be; and he made such men sit to him for hours.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that this close observer, who could
display<br>
 unrivalled tact in developing a joke or driving home a sarcasm,
was<br>
 unable to use the same power to make men further his fortunes
and<br>
 promote him. The person he most liked to annoy was young La<br>
 Billardiere, his nightmare, his detestation, whom he was
nevertheless<br>
 constantly wheedling so as the better to torment him on his
weakest<br>
 side. He wrote him love letters signed "Comtesse de M--" or
"Marquise<br>
 de B--"; took him to the Opera on gala days and presented him to
some<br>
 grisette under the clock, after calling everybody's attention to
the<br>
 young fool. He allied himself with Dutocq (whom he regarded as
a<br>
 solemn juggler) in his hatred to Rabourdin and his praise of
Baudoyer,<br>
 and did his best to support him. Jean-Jaques Bixiou was the
grandson<br>
 of a Parisian grocer. His father, who died a colonel, left him
to the<br>
 care of his grandmother, who married her head-clerk, named
Descoings,<br>
 after the death of her first husband, and died in 1822.
Finding<br>
 himself without prospects on leaving college, he attempted
painting,<br>
 but in spite of his intimacy with Joseph Bridau, his life-long
friend,<br>
 he abandoned art to take up caricature, vignette designing,
and<br>
 drawing for books, which twenty years later went by the name
of<br>
 "illustration." The influence of the Ducs de Maufrigneuse and
de<br>
 Rhetore, whom he knew in the society of actresses, procured him
his<br>
 employment under government in 1819. On good terms with des
Lupeaulx,<br>
 with whom in society he stood on an equality, and intimate with
du<br>
 Bruel, he was a living proof of Rabourdin's theory as to the
steady<br>
 deterioration of the administrative hierarchy in Paris through
the<br>
 personal importance which a government official may acquire
outside of<br>
 a government office. Short in stature but well-formed, with a
delicate<br>
 face remarkable for its vague likeness to Napoleon's, thin lips,
a<br>
 straight chin, chestnut whiskers, twenty-seven years old,
fair-<br>
 skinned, with a piercing voice and sparkling eye,--such was
Bixiou; a<br>
 man, all sense and all wit, who abandoned himself to a mad
pursuit of<br>
 pleasure of every description, which threw him into a constant
round<br>
 of dissipation. Hunter of grisettes, smoker, jester, diner-out
and<br>
 frequenter of supper-parties, always tuned to the highest
pitch,<br>
 shining equally in the greenroom and at the balls given among
the<br>
 grisettes of the Allee des Veuves, he was just as
surprisingly<br>
 entertaining at table as at a picnic, as gay and lively at
midnight on<br>
 the streets as in the morning when he jumped out of bed, and yet
at<br>
 heart gloomy and melancholy, like most of the great comic
players.</p>

<p>Launched into the world of actors and actresses, writers,
artists, and<br>
 certain women of uncertain means, he lived well, went to the
theatre<br>
 without paying, gambled at Frascati, and often won. Artist by
nature<br>
 and really profound, though by flashes only, he swayed to and
fro in<br>
 life like a swing, without thinking or caring of a time when the
cord<br>
 would break. The liveliness of his wit and the prodigal flow of
his<br>
 ideas made him acceptable to all persons who took pleasure in
the<br>
 lights of intellect; but none of his friends liked him.
Incapable of<br>
 checking a witty saying, he would scarify his two neighbors
before a<br>
 dinner was half over. In spite of his skin-deep gayety, a
secret<br>
 dissatisfaction with his social position could be detected in
his<br>
 speech; he aspired to something better, but the fatal demon
hiding in<br>
 his wit hindered him from acquiring the gravity which imposes
on<br>
 fools. He lived on the second floor of a house in the rue de
Ponthieu,<br>
 where he had three rooms delivered over to the untidiness of
a<br>
 bachelor's establishment, in fact, a regular bivouac. He often
talked<br>
 of leaving France and seeking his fortune in America. No wizard
could<br>
 foretell the future of this young man in whom all talents
were<br>
 incomplete; who was incapable of perseverance, intoxicated
with<br>
 pleasure, and who acted on the belief that the world ended on
the<br>
 morrow.</p>

<p>In the matter of dress Bixiou had the merit of never being
ridiculous;<br>
 he was perhaps the only official of the ministry whose dress did
not<br>
 lead outsiders to say, "That man is a government clerk!" He
wore<br>
 elegant boots with black trousers strapped under them, a
fancy<br>
 waistcoat, a becoming blue coat, collars that were the
never-ending<br>
 gift of grisettes, one of Bandoni's hats, and a pair of
dark-colored<br>
 kid gloves. His walk and bearing, cavalier and simple both, were
not<br>
 without grace. He knew all this, and when des Lupeaulx summoned
him<br>
 for a piece of impertinence said and done about Monsieur de
la<br>
 Billardiere and threatened him with dismissal, Bixiou replied,
"You<br>
 will take me back because my clothes do credit to the ministry";
and<br>
 des Lupeaulx, unable to keep from laughing, let the matter pass.
The<br>
 most harmless of Bixiou's jokes perpetrated among the clerks was
the<br>
 one he played off upon Godard, presenting him with a butterfly
just<br>
 brought from China, which the worthy man keeps in his collection
and<br>
 exhibits to this day, blissfully unconscious that it is only
painted<br>
 paper. Bixiou had the patience to work up the little masterpiece
for<br>
 the sole purpose of hoaxing his superior.</p>

<p>The devil always puts a martyr near a Bixiou. Baudoyer's
bureau held<br>
 the martyr, a poor copying-clerk twenty-two years of age, with
a<br>
 salary of fifteen hundred francs, named Auguste-Jean-Francois
Minard.<br>
 Minard had married for love the daughter of a porter, an
artificial-<br>
 flower maker employed by Mademoiselle Godard. Zelie Lorrain, a
pupil,<br>
 in the first place, of the Conservatoire, then by turns a
danseuse, a<br>
 singer, and an actress, had thought of doing as so many of
the<br>
 working-women do; but the fear of consequences kept her from
vice. She<br>
 was floating undecidedly along, when Minard appeared upon the
scene<br>
 with a definite proposal of marriage. Zelie earned five hundred
francs<br>
 a year, Minard had fifteen hundred. Believing that they could
live on<br>
 two thousand, they married without settlements, and started with
the<br>
 utmost economy. They went to live, like dove-turtles, near
the<br>
 barriere de Courcelles, in a little apartment at three hundred
francs<br>
 a year, with white cotton curtains to the windows, a Scotch
paper<br>
 costing fifteen sous a roll on the walls, brick floors well
polished,<br>
 walnut furniture in the parlor, and a tiny kitchen that was
very<br>
 clean. Zelie nursed her children herself when they came, cooked,
made<br>
 her flowers, and kept the house. There was something very
touching in<br>
 this happy and laborious mediocrity. Feeling that Minard truly
loved<br>
 her, Zelie loved him. Love begets love,--it is the abyssus
abyssum of<br>
 the Bible. The poor man left his bed in the morning before his
wife<br>
 was up, that he might fetch provisions. He carried the flowers
she had<br>
 finished, on his way to the bureau, and bought her materials on
his<br>
 way back; then, while waiting for dinner, he stamped out her
leaves,<br>
 trimmed the twigs, or rubbed her colors. Small, slim, and wiry,
with<br>
 crisp red hair, eyes of a light yellow, a skin of dazzling
fairness,<br>
 though blotched with red, the man had a sturdy courage that made
no<br>
 show. He knew the science of writing quite as well as Vimeux. At
the<br>
 office he kept in the background, doing his allotted task with
the<br>
 collected air of a man who thinks and suffers. His white
eyelashes and<br>
 lack of eyebrows induced the relentless Bixiou to name him "the
white<br>
 rabbit." Minard--the Rabourdin of a lower sphere--was filled
with the<br>
 desire of placing his Zelie in better circumstances, and his
mind<br>
 searched the ocean of the wants of luxury in hopes of finding an
idea,<br>
 of making some discovery or some improvement which would bring
him a<br>
 rapid fortune. His apparent dulness was really caused by the
continual<br>
 tension of his mind; he went over the history of Cephalic Oils
and the<br>
 Paste of Sultans, lucifer matches and portable gas, jointed
sockets<br>
 for hydrostatic lamps,--in short, all the infinitely little
inventions<br>
 of material civilization which pay so well. He bore Bixiou's
jests as<br>
 a busy man bears the buzzing of an insect; he was not even
annoyed by<br>
 them. In spite of his cleverness, Bixiou never perceived the
profound<br>
 contempt which Minard felt for him. Minard never dreamed of<br>
 quarrelling, however,--regarding it as a loss of time. After a
while<br>
 his composure tired out his tormentor. He always breakfasted
with his<br>
 wife, and ate nothing at the office. Once a month he took Zelie
to the<br>
 theatre, with tickets bestowed by du Bruel or Bixiou; for Bixiou
was<br>
 capable of anything, even of doing a kindness. Monsieur and
Madame<br>
 Minard paid their visits in person on New-Year's day. Those who
saw<br>
 them often asked how it was that a woman could keep her husband
in<br>
 good clothes, wear a Leghorn bonnet with flowers, embroidered
muslin<br>
 dresses, silk mantles, prunella boots, handsome fichus, a
Chinese<br>
 parasol, and drive home in a hackney-coach, and yet be virtuous;
while<br>
 Madame Colleville and other "ladies" of her kind could scarcely
make<br>
 ends meet, though they had double Madame Minard's means.</p>

<p>In the two bureaus were two clerks so devoted to each other
that their<br>
 friendship became the butt of all the rest. He of the bureau
Baudoyer,<br>
 named Colleville, was chief-clerk, and would have been head of
the<br>
 bureau long before if the Restoration had never happened. His
wife was<br>
 as clever in her way as Madame Rabourdin in hers. Colleville,
who was<br>
 son of a first violin at the opera, fell in love with the
daughter of<br>
 a celebrated danseuse. Flavie Minoret, one of those capable
and<br>
 charming Parisian women who know how to make their husbands
happy and<br>
 yet preserve their own liberty, made the Colleville home a
rendezvous<br>
 for all our best artists and orators. Colleville's humble
position<br>
 under government was forgotten there. Flavie's conduct gave such
food<br>
 for gossip, however, that Madame Rabourdin had declined all
her<br>
 invitations. The friend in Rabourdin's bureau to whom Colleville
was<br>
 so attached was named Thuillier. All who knew one knew the
other.<br>
 Thuillier, called "the handsome Thuillier," an ex-Lothario, led
as<br>
 idle a life as Colleville led a busy one. Colleville,
government<br>
 official in the mornings and first clarionet at the
Opera-Comique at<br>
 night, worked hard to maintain his family, though he was not
without<br>
 influential friends. He was looked upon as a very shrewd
man,--all the<br>
 more, perhaps, because he hid his ambitions under a show of<br>
 indifference. Apparently content with his lot and liking work,
he<br>
 found every one, even the chiefs, ready to protect his brave
career.<br>
 During the last few weeks Madame Colleville had made an evident
change<br>
 in the household, and seemed to be taking to piety. This gave
rise to<br>
 a vague report in the bureaus that she thought of securing some
more<br>
 powerful influence than that of Francois Keller, the famous
orator,<br>
 who had been one of her chief adorers, but who, so far, had
failed to<br>
 obtain a better place for her husband. Flavie had, about this
time--<br>
 and it was one of her mistakes--turned for help to des
Lupeaulx.</p>

<p>Colleville had a passion for reading the horoscopes of famous
men in<br>
 the anagram of their names. He passed whole months in
decomposing and<br>
 recomposing words and fitting them to new meanings. "Un Corse
la<br>
 finira," found within the words, "Revolution Francaise"; "Eh,
c'est<br>
 large nez," in "Charles Genest," an abbe at the court of Louis
XIV.,<br>
 whose huge nose is recorded by Saint-Simon as the delight of the
Duc<br>
 de Bourgogne (the exigencies of this last anagram required
the<br>
 substitution of a z for an s),--were a never-ending marvel
to<br>
 Colleville. Raising the anagram to the height of a science,
he<br>
 declared that the destiny of every man was written in the words
or<br>
 phrase given by the transposition of the letters of his names
and<br>
 titles; and his patriotism struggled hard to suppress the
fact--signal<br>
 evidence for his theory--that in Horatio Nelson, "honor est a
Nilo."<br>
 Ever since the accession of Charles X., he had bestowed much
thought<br>
 on the king's anagram. Thuillier, who was fond of making
puns,<br>
 declared that an anagram was nothing more than a pun on letters.
The<br>
 sight of Colleville, a man of real feeling, bound almost
indissolubly<br>
 to Thuillier, the model of an egoist, presented a difficult
problem to<br>
 the mind of an observer. The clerks in the offices explained it
by<br>
 saying, "Thuillier is rich, and the Colleville household
costly." This<br>
 friendship, however, consolidated by time, was based on feelings
and<br>
 on facts which naturally explained it; an account of which may
be<br>
 found elsewhere (see "Les Petits Bourgeois"). We may remark in
passing<br>
 that though Madame Colleville was well known in the bureaus,
the<br>
 existence of Madame Thuillier was almost unknown there.
Colleville, an<br>
 active man, burdened with a family of children, was fat, round,
and<br>
 jolly, whereas Thuillier, "the beau of the Empire" without
apparent<br>
 anxieties and always at leisure, was slender and thin, with a
livid<br>
 face and a melancholy air. "We never know," said Rabourdin,
speaking<br>
 of the two men, "whether our friendships are born of likeness or
of<br>
 contrast."</p>

<p>Unlike these Siamese twins, two other clerks, Chazelle and
Paulmier,<br>
 were forever squabbling. One smoked, the other took snuff, and
the<br>
 merits of their respective use of tobacco were the origin of
ceaseless<br>
 disputes. Chazelle's home, which was tyrannized over by a
wife,<br>
 furnished a subject of endless ridicule to Paulmier; whereas
Paulmier,<br>
 a bachelor, often half-starved like Vimeux, with ragged clothes
and<br>
 half-concealed penury was a fruitful source of ridicule to
Chazelle.<br>
 Both were beginning to show a protuberant stomach; Chazelle's,
which<br>
 was round and projecting, had the impertinence, so Bixiou said,
to<br>
 enter the room first; Paulmier's corporation spread to right and
left.<br>
 A favorite amusement with Bixiou was to measure them quarterly.
The<br>
 two clerks, by dint of quarrelling over the details of their
lives,<br>
 and washing much of their dirty linen at the office, had
obtained the<br>
 disrepute which they merited. "Do you take me for a Chazelle?"
was a<br>
 frequent saying that served to end many an annoying
discussion.</p>

<p>Monsieur Poiret junior, called "junior" to distinguish him
from his<br>
 brother Monsieur Poiret senior (now living in the Maison
Vanquer,<br>
 where Poiret junior sometimes dined, intending to end his days
in the<br>
 same retreat), had spent thirty years in the Civil Service.
Nature<br>
 herself is not so fixed and unvarying in her evolutions as was
Poiret<br>
 junior in all the acts of his daily life; he always laid his
things in<br>
 precisely the same place, put his pen in the same rack, sat down
in<br>
 his seat at the same hour, warmed himself at the stove at the
same<br>
 moment of the day. His sole vanity consisted in wearing an
infallible<br>
 watch, timed daily at the Hotel de Ville as he passed it on his
way to<br>
 the office. From six to eight o'clock in the morning he kept the
books<br>
 of a large shop in the rue Saint-Antoine, and from six to
eight<br>
 o'clock in the evening those of the Maison Camusot, in the rue
des<br>
 Bourdonnais. He thus earned three thousand francs a year,
counting his<br>
 salary from the government. In a few months his term of service
would<br>
 be up, when he would retire on a pension; he therefore showed
the<br>
 utmost indifference to the political intrigues of the bureaus.
Like<br>
 his elder brother, to whom retirement from active service had
proved a<br>
 fatal blow, he would probably grow an old man when he could no
longer<br>
 come from his home to the ministry, sit in the same chair and
copy a<br>
 certain number of pages. Poiret's eyes were dim, his glance weak
and<br>
 lifeless, his skin discolored and wrinkled, gray in tone and
speckled<br>
 with bluish dots; his nose flat, his lips drawn inward to the
mouth,<br>
 where a few defective teeth still lingered. His gray hair,
flattened<br>
 to the head by the pressure of his hat, gave him the look of
an<br>
 ecclesiastic,--a resemblance he would scarcely have liked, for
he<br>
 hated priests and clergy, though he could give no reasons for
his<br>
 anti-religious views. This antipathy, however, did not prevent
him<br>
 from being extremely attached to whatever administration
happened to<br>
 be in power. He never buttoned his old green coat, even on the
coldest<br>
 days, and he always wore shoes with ties, and black
trousers.</p>

<p><br>
 No human life was ever lived so thoroughly by rule. Poiret kept
all<br>
 his receipted bills, even the most trifling, and all his
account-<br>
 books, wrapped in old shirts and put away according to their<br>
 respective years from the time of his entrance at the ministry.
Rough<br>
 copies of his letters were dated and put away in a box, ticketed
"My<br>
 Correspondence." He dined at the same restaurant (the Sucking
Calf in<br>
 the place du Chatelet), and sat in the same place, which the
waiters<br>
 kept for him. He never gave five minutes more time to the shop
in the<br>
 rue Saint Antoine than justly belonged to it, and at half-past
eight<br>
 precisely he reached the Cafe David, where he breakfasted and
remained<br>
 till eleven. There he listened to political discussions, his
arms<br>
 crossed on his cane, his chin in his right hand, never saying a
word.<br>
 The dame du comptoir, the only woman to whom he ever spoke
with<br>
 pleasure, was the sole confidant of the little events of his
life, for<br>
 his seat was close to her counter. He played dominoes, the only
game<br>
 he was capable of understanding. When his partners did not
happen to<br>
 be present, he usually went to sleep with his back against
the<br>
 wainscot, holding a newspaper in his hand, the wooden file
resting on<br>
 the marble of his table. He was interested in the buildings
going up<br>
 in Paris, and spent his Sundays in walking about to examine
them. He<br>
 was often heard to say, "I saw the Louvre emerge from its
rubbish; I<br>
 saw the birth of the place du Chatelet, the quai aux Fleurs and
the<br>
 Markets." He and his brother, both born at Troyes, were sent in
youth<br>
 to serve their apprenticeship in a government office. Their
mother<br>
 made herself notorious by misconduct, and the two brothers had
the<br>
 grief of hearing of her death in the hospital at Troyes,
although they<br>
 had frequently sent money for her support. This event led them
both<br>
 not only to abjure marriage, but to feel a horror of children;
ill at<br>
 ease with them, they feared them as others fear madmen, and
watched<br>
 them with haggard eyes.</p>

<p>Since the day when he first came to Paris Poiret junior had
never gone<br>
 outside the city. He began at that time to keep a journal of his
life,<br>
 in which he noted down all the striking events of his day. Du
Bruel<br>
 told him that Lord Byron did the same thing. This likeness
filled<br>
 Poiret junior with delight, and led him to buy the works of
Lord<br>
 Byron, translated by Chastopalli, of which he did not understand
a<br>
 word. At the office he was often seen in a melancholy attitude,
as<br>
 though absorbed in thought, when in fact he was thinking of
nothing at<br>
 all. He did not know a single person in the house where he
lived, and<br>
 always carried the keys of his apartment about with him. On
New-Year's<br>
 day he went round and left his own cards on all the clerks of
the<br>
 division. Bixiou took it into his head on one of the hottest of
dog-<br>
 days to put a layer of lard under the lining of a certain old
hat<br>
 which Poiret junior (he was, by the bye, fifty-two years old)
had worn<br>
 for the last nine years. Bixiou, who had never seen any other
hat on<br>
 Poiret's head, dreamed of it and declared he tasted it in his
food; he<br>
 therefore resolved, in the interests of his digestion, to
relieve the<br>
 bureau of the sight of that amorphous old hat. Poiret junior
left the<br>
 office regularly at four o'clock. As he walked along, the sun's
rays<br>
 reflected from the pavements and walls produced a tropical heat;
he<br>
 felt that his head was inundated,--he, who never perspired!
Feeling<br>
 that he was ill, or on the point of being so, instead of going
as<br>
 usual to the Sucking Calf he went home, drew out from his desk
the<br>
 journal of his life, and recorded the fact in the following
manner:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To-day, July 3, 1823, overtaken by extraordinary
perspiration, a<br>
 sign, perhaps, of the sweating-sickness, a malady which
prevails<br>
 in Champagne. I am about to consult Doctor Haudry. The
disease<br>
 first appeared as I reached the highest part of the quai des<br>
 Ecoles."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suddenly, having taken off his hat, he became aware that
the<br>
 mysterious sweat had some cause independent of his own person.
He<br>
 wiped his face, examined the hat, and could find nothing, for he
did<br>
 not venture to take out the lining. All this he noted in his<br>
 journal:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Carried my hat to the Sieur Tournan, hat-maker in the rue
Saint-<br>
 Martin, for the reason that I suspect some unknown cause for
this<br>
 perspiration, which, in that case, might not be perspiration,
but,<br>
 possibly, the effect of something lately added, or formerly
done,<br>
 to my hat."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Monsieur Tournan at once informed his customer of the presence
of a<br>
 greasy substance, obtained by the trying-out of the fat of a pig
or<br>
 sow. The next day Poiret appeared at the office with another
hat, lent<br>
 by Monsieur Tournan while a new one was making; but he did not
sleep<br>
 that night until he had added the following sentence to the
preceding<br>
 entries in his journal: "It is asserted that my hat contained
lard,<br>
 the fat of a pig."</p>

<p><br>
 This inexplicable fact occupied the intellect of Poiret junior
for the<br>
 space of two weeks; and he never knew how the phenomenon was
produced.<br>
 The clerks told him tales of showers of frogs, and other
dog-day<br>
 wonders, also the startling fact that an imprint of the head
of<br>
 Napoleon had been found in the root of a young elm, with
other<br>
 eccentricities of natural history. Vimeux informed him that one
day<br>
 his hat--his, Vimeux's--had stained his forehead black, and that
hat-<br>
 makers were in the habit of using drugs. After that Poiret paid
many<br>
 visits to Monsieur Tournan to inquire into his methods of
manufacture.</p>

<p>In the Rabourdin bureau was a clerk who played the man of
courage and<br>
 audacity, professed the opinions of the Left centre, and
rebelled<br>
 against the tyrannies of Baudoyer as exercised upon what he
called the<br>
 unhappy slaves of that office. His name was Fleury. He
boldly<br>
 subscribed to an opposition newspaper, wore a gray hat with a
broad<br>
 brim, red bands on his blue trousers, a blue waistcoat with
gilt<br>
 buttons, and a surtout coat crossed over the breast like that of
a<br>
 quartermaster of gendarmerie. Though unyielding in his opinions,
he<br>
 continued to be employed in the service, all the while
predicting a<br>
 fatal end to a government which persisted in upholding religion.
He<br>
 openly avowed his sympathy for Napoleon, now that the death of
that<br>
 great man put an end to the laws enacted against "the partisans
of the<br>
 usurper." Fleury, ex-captain of a regiment of the line under
the<br>
 Emperor, a tall, dark, handsome fellow, was now, in addition to
his<br>
 civil-service post, box-keeper at the Cirque-Olympique. Bixiou
never<br>
 ventured on tormenting Fleury, for the rough trooper, who was a
good<br>
 shot and clever at fencing, seemed quite capable of extreme
brutality<br>
 if provoked. An ardent subscriber to "Victoires et Conquetes,"
Fleury<br>
 nevertheless refused to pay his subscription, though he kept and
read<br>
 the copies, alleging that they exceeded the number proposed in
the<br>
 prospectus. He adored Monsieur Rabourdin, who had saved him
from<br>
 dismissal, and was even heard to say that if any misfortune
happened<br>
 to the chief through anybody's fault he would kill that person.
Dutocq<br>
 meanly courted Fleury because he feared him. Fleury, crippled
with<br>
 debt, played many a trick on his creditors. Expert in legal
matters,<br>
 he never signed a promissory note; and had prudently attached
his own<br>
 salary under the names of fictitious creditors, so that he was
able to<br>
 draw nearly the whole of it himself. He played ecarte, was the
life of<br>
 evening parties, tossed off glasses of champagne without wetting
his<br>
 lips, and knew all the songs of Beranger by heart. He was proud
of his<br>
 full, sonorous voice. His three great admirations were
Napoleon,<br>
 Bolivar, and Beranger. Foy, Lafitte, and Casimir Delavigne he
only<br>
 esteemed. Fleury, as you will have guessed already, was a
Southerner,<br>
 destined, no doubt, to become the responsible editor of a
liberal<br>
 journal.</p>

<p>Desroys, the mysterious clerk of the division, consorted with
no one,<br>
 talked little, and hid his private life so carefully that no one
knew<br>
 where he lived, nor who were his protectors, nor what were his
means<br>
 of subsistence. Looking about them for the causes of this
reserve,<br>
 some of his colleagues thought him a "carbonaro," others an
Orleanist;<br>
 there were others again who doubted whether to call him a spy or
a man<br>
 of solid merit. Desroys was, however, simple and solely the son
of a<br>
 "Conventionel," who did not vote the king's death. Cold and
prudent by<br>
 temperament, he had judged the world and ended by relying on no
one<br>
 but himself. Republican in secret, an admirer of Paul-Louis
Courier<br>
 and a friend of Michael Chrestien, he looked to time and
public<br>
 intelligence to bring about the triumph of his opinions from end
to<br>
 end of Europe. He dreamed of a new Germany and a new Italy. His
heart<br>
 swelled with that dull, collective love which we must call<br>
 humanitarianism, the eldest son of deceased philanthropy, and
which is<br>
 to the divine catholic charity what system is to art, or
reasoning to<br>
 deed. This conscientious puritan of freedom, this apostle of
an<br>
 impossible equality, regretted keenly that his poverty forced
him to<br>
 serve the government, and he made various efforts to find a
place<br>
 elsewhere. Tall, lean, lanky, and solemn in appearance, like a
man who<br>
 expects to be called some day to lay down his life for a cause,
he<br>
 lived on a page of Volney, studied Saint-Just, and employed
himself on<br>
 a vindication of Robespierre, whom he regarded as the successor
of<br>
 Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The last of the individuals belonging to these bureaus who
merits a<br>
 sketch here is the little La Billardiere. Having, to his
great<br>
 misfortune, lost his mother, and being under the protection of
the<br>
 minister, safe therefore from the tyrannies of Baudoyer, and
received<br>
 in all the ministerial salons, he was nevertheless detested by
every<br>
 one because of his impertinence and conceit. The two chiefs
were<br>
 polite to him, but the clerks held him at arm's length and
prevented<br>
 all companionship by means of the extreme and grotesque
politeness<br>
 which they bestowed upon him. A pretty youth of twenty-two, tall
and<br>
 slender, with the manners of an Englishman, a dandy in dress,
curled<br>
 and perfumed, gloved and booted in the latest fashion, and
twirling an<br>
 eyeglass, Benjamin de la Billardiere thought himself a charming
fellow<br>
 and possessed all the vices of the world with none of its
graces. He<br>
 was now looking forward impatiently to the death of his father,
that<br>
 he might succeed to the title of baron. His cards were printed
"le<br>
 Chevalier de la Billardiere" and on the wall of his office hung,
in a<br>
 frame, his coat of arms (sable, two swords in saltire, on a
chief<br>
 azure three mullets argent; with the motto; "Toujours
fidele").<br>
 Possessed with a mania for talking heraldry, he once asked the
young<br>
 Vicomte de Portenduere why his arms were charged in a certain
way, and<br>
 drew down upon himself the happy answer, "I did not make them."
He<br>
 talked of his devotion to the monarchy and the attentions the
Dauphine<br>
 paid him. He stood very well with des Lupeaulx, whom he thought
his<br>
 friend, and they often breakfasted together. Bixiou posed as
his<br>
 mentor, and hoped to rid the division and France of the young
fool by<br>
 tempting him to excesses, and openly avowed that intention.</p>

<p>Such were the principal figures of La Billardiere's division
of the<br>
 ministry, where also were other clerks of less account, who
resembled<br>
 more or less those that are represented here. It is difficult
even for<br>
 an observer to decide from the aspect of these strange
personalities<br>
 whether the goose-quill tribe were becoming idiots from the
effects of<br>
 their employment or whether they entered the service because
they were<br>
 natural born fools. Possibly the making of them lies at the door
of<br>
 Nature and of the government both. Nature, to a civil-service
clerk<br>
 is, in fact, the sphere of the office; his horizon is bounded on
all<br>
 sides by green boxes; to him, atmospheric changes are the air of
the<br>
 corridors, the masculine exhalations contained in rooms
without<br>
 ventilators, the odor of paper, pens, and ink; the soil he
treads is a<br>
 tiled pavement or a wooden floor, strewn with a curious litter
and<br>
 moistened by the attendant's watering-pot; his sky is the
ceiling<br>
 toward which he yawns; his element is dust. Several
distinguished<br>
 doctors have remonstrated against the influence of this second
nature,<br>
 both savage and civilized, on the moral being vegetating in
those<br>
 dreadful pens called bureaus, where the sun seldom penetrates,
where<br>
 thoughts are tied down to occupations like that of horses who
turn a<br>
 crank and who, poor beasts, yawn distressingly and die
quickly.<br>
 Rabourdin was, therefore, fully justified in seeking to reform
their<br>
 present condition, by lessening their numbers and giving to each
a<br>
 larger salary and far heavier work. Men are neither wearied nor
bored<br>
 when doing great things. Under the present system government
loses<br>
 fully four hours out of the nine which the clerks owe to the
service,<br>
 --hours wasted, as we shall see, in conversations, in gossip,
in<br>
 disputes, and, above all, in underhand intriguing. The reader
must<br>
 have haunted the bureaus of the ministerial departments before
he can<br>
 realize how much their petty and belittling life resembles that
of<br>
 seminaries. Wherever men live collectively this likeness is
obvious;<br>
 in regiments, in law-courts, you will find the elements of the
school<br>
 on a smaller or larger scale. The government clerks, forced to
be<br>
 together for nine hours of the day, looked upon their office as
a sort<br>
 of class-room where they had tasks to perform, where the head of
the<br>
 bureau was no other than a schoolmaster, and where the
gratuities<br>
 bestowed took the place of prizes given out to proteges,--a
place,<br>
 moreover, where they teased and hated each other, and yet felt
a<br>
 certain comradeship, colder than that of a regiment, which
itself is<br>
 less hearty than that of seminaries. As a man advances in life
he<br>
 grows more selfish; egoism develops, and relaxes all the
secondary<br>
 bonds of affection. A government office is, in short, a
microcosm of<br>
 society, with its oddities and hatreds, its envy and its
cupidity, its<br>
 determination to push on, no matter who goes under, its
frivolous<br>
 gossip which gives so many wounds, and its perpetual spying.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h4>THE MACHINE IN MOTION</h4>

<p>At this moment the division of Monsieur de la Billardiere was
in a<br>
 state of unusual excitement, resulting very naturally from the
event<br>
 which was about to happen; for heads of divisions do not die
every<br>
 day, and there is no insurance office where the chances of life
and<br>
 death are calculated with more sagacity than in a government
bureau.<br>
 Self-interest stifles all compassion, as it does in children,
but the<br>
 government service adds hypocrisy to boot.</p>

<p><br>
 The clerks of the bureau Baudoyer arrived at eight o'clock in
the<br>
 morning, whereas those of the bureau Rabourdin seldom appeared
till<br>
 nine,--a circumstance which did not prevent the work in the
latter<br>
 office from being more rapidly dispatched than that of the
former.<br>
 Dutocq had important reasons for coming early on this
particular<br>
 morning. The previous evening he had furtively entered the study
where<br>
 Sebastien was at work, and had seen him copying some papers
for<br>
 Rabourdin; he concealed himself until he saw Sebastien leave
the<br>
 premises without taking any papers away with him. Certain,
therefore,<br>
 of finding the rather voluminous memorandum which he had
seen,<br>
 together with its copy, in some corner of the study, he
searched<br>
 through the boxes one after another until he finally came upon
the<br>
 fatal list. He carried it in hot haste to an autograph-printing
house,<br>
 where he obtained two pressed copies of the memorandum, showing,
of<br>
 course, Rabourdin's own writing. Anxious not to arouse
suspicion, he<br>
 had gone very early to the office and replaced both the
memorandum and<br>
 Sebastien's copy in the box from which he had taken them.
Sebastien,<br>
 who was kept up till after midnight at Madame Rabourdin's party,
was,<br>
 in spite of his desire to get to the office early, preceded by
the<br>
 spirit of hatred. Hatred lived in the rue
Saint-Louis-Saint-Honore,<br>
 whereas love and devotion lived far-off in the rue du Roi-Dore
in the<br>
 Marais. This slight delay was destined to affect Rabourdin's
whole<br>
 career.</p>

<p>Sebastien opened his box eagerly, found the memorandum and his
own<br>
 unfinished copy all in order, and locked them at once into the
desk as<br>
 Rabourdin had directed. The mornings are dark in these offices
towards<br>
 the end of December, sometimes indeed the lamps are lit till
after ten<br>
 o'clock; consequently Sebastien did not happen to notice the
pressure<br>
 of the copying-machine upon the paper. But when, about half-past
nine<br>
 o'clock, Rabourdin looked at his memorandum he saw at once the
effects<br>
 of the copying process, and all the more readily because he was
then<br>
 considering whether these autographic presses could not be made
to do<br>
 the work of copying clerks.</p>

<p>"Did any one get to the office before you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sebastien,--"Monsieur Dutocq."</p>

<p>"Ah! well, he was punctual. Send Antoine to me."</p>

<p>Too noble to distress Sebastien uselessly by blaming him for
a<br>
 misfortune now beyond remedy, Rabourdin said no more. Antoine
came.<br>
 Rabourdin asked if any clerk had remained at the office after
four<br>
 o'clock the previous evening. The man replied that Monsieur
Dutocq had<br>
 worked there later than Monsieur de la Roche, who was usually
the last<br>
 to leave. Rabourdin dismissed him with a nod, and resumed the
thread<br>
 of his reflections.</p>

<p>"Twice I have prevented his dismissal," he said to himself,
"and this<br>
 is my reward."</p>

<p>This morning was to Rabourdin like the solemn hour in which
great<br>
 commanders decide upon a battle and weigh all chances. Knowing
the<br>
 spirit of official life better than any one, he well knew that
it<br>
 would never pardon, any more than a school or the galleys or the
army<br>
 pardon, what looked like espionage or tale-bearing. A man
capable of<br>
 informing against his comrades is disgraced, dishonored,
despised; the<br>
 ministers in such a case would disavow their own agents. Nothing
was<br>
 left to an official so placed but to send in his resignation and
leave<br>
 Paris; his honor is permanently stained; explanations are of no
avail;<br>
 no one will either ask for them or listen to them. A minister
may well<br>
 do the same thing and be thought a great man, able to choose the
right<br>
 instruments; but a mere subordinate will be judged as a spy, no
matter<br>
 what may be his motives. While justly measuring the folly of
such<br>
 judgment, Rabourdin knew that it was all-powerful; and he knew,
too,<br>
 that he was crushed. More surprised than overwhelmed, he now
sought<br>
 for the best course to follow under the circumstances; and with
such<br>
 thoughts in his mind he was necessarily aloof from the
excitement<br>
 caused in the division by the death of Monsieur de la
Billardiere; in<br>
 fact he did not hear of it until young La Briere, who was able
to<br>
 appreciate his sterling value, came to tell him. About ten
o'clock, in<br>
 the bureau Baudoyer, Bixiou was relating the last moments of the
life<br>
 of the director to Minard, Desroys, Monsieur Godard, whom he
had<br>
 called from his private office, and Dutocq, who had rushed in
with<br>
 private motives of his own. Colleville and Chazelle were
absent.</p>

<p>Bixiou [standing with his back to the stove and holding up the
sole of<br>
 each boot alternately to dry at the open door]. "This morning,
at half-<br>
 past seven, I went to inquire after our most worthy and
respectable<br>
 director, knight of the order of Christ, et caetera, et caetera.
Yes,<br>
 gentlemen, last night he was a being with twenty et caeteras,
to-day<br>
 he is nothing, not even a government clerk. I asked all
particulars of<br>
 his nurse. She told me that this morning at five o'clock he
became<br>
 uneasy about the royal family. He asked for the names of all
the<br>
 clerks who had called to inquire after him; and then he said:
'Fill my<br>
 snuff-box, give me the newspaper, bring my spectacles, and
change my<br>
 ribbon of the Legion of honor,--it is very dirty.' I suppose you
know<br>
 he always wore his orders in bed. He was fully conscious,
retained his<br>
 senses and all his usual ideas. But, presto! ten minutes later
the<br>
 water rose, rose, rose and flooded his chest; he knew he was
dying for<br>
 he felt the cysts break. At that fatal moment he gave evident
proof of<br>
 his powerful mind and vast intellect. Ah, we never rightly
appreciated<br>
 him! We used to laugh at him and call him a booby--didn't
you,<br>
 Monsieur Godard?"</p>

<p>Godard. "I? I always rated Monsieur de la Billardiere's
talents higher<br>
 than the rest of you."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "You and he could understand each other!"</p>

<p>Godard. "He wasn't a bad man; he never harmed any one."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "To do harm you must do something, and he never did
anything.<br>
 If it wasn't you who said he was a dolt, it must have been
Minard."</p>

<p>Minard [shrugging his shoulders]. "I!"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Well, then it was you, Dutocq!" [Dutocq made a
vehement<br>
 gesture of denial.] "Oh! very good, then it was nobody. Every
one in<br>
 this office knew his intellect was herculean. Well, you were
right. He<br>
 ended, as I have said, like the great man that he was."</p>

<p>Desroys [impatiently]. "Pray what did he do that was so great?
he had<br>
 the weakness to confess himself."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Yes, monsieur, he received the holy sacraments. But
do you<br>
 know what he did in order to receive them? He put on his uniform
as<br>
 gentleman-in-ordinary of the Bedchamber, with all his orders,
and had<br>
 himself powdered; they tied his queue (that poor queue!) with a
fresh<br>
 ribbon. Now I say that none but a man of remarkable character
would<br>
 have his queue tied with a fresh ribbon just as he was dying.
There<br>
 are eight of us here, and I don't believe one among us is
capable of<br>
 such an act. But that's not all; he said,--for you know all
celebrated<br>
 men make a dying speech; he said,--stop now, what did he say?
Ah! he<br>
 said, 'I must attire myself to meet the King of Heaven,--I, who
have<br>
 so often dressed in my best for audience with the kings of
earth.'<br>
 That's how Monsieur de la Billardiere departed this life. He
took upon<br>
 himself to justify the saying of Pythagoras, 'No man is known
until he<br>
 dies.'"</p>

<p>Colleville [rushing in]. "Gentlemen, great news!"</p>

<p>All. "We know it."</p>

<p>Colleville. "I defy you to know it! I have been hunting for it
ever<br>
 since the accession of His Majesty to the thrones of France and
of<br>
 Navarre. Last night I succeeded! but with what labor! Madame<br>
 Colleville asked me what was the matter."</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Do you think we have time to bother ourselves with
your<br>
 intolerable anagrams when the worthy Monsieur de la Billardiere
has<br>
 just expired?"</p>

<p>Colleville. "That's Bixiou's nonsense! I have just come from
Monsieur<br>
 de la Billardiere's; he is still living, though they expect him
to die<br>
 soon." [Godard, indignant at the hoax, goes off grumbling.]<br>
 "Gentlemen! you would never guess what extraordinary events
are<br>
 revealed by the anagram of this sacramental sentence" [he pulls
out a<br>
 piece of paper and reads], "Charles dix, par la grace de Dieu,
roi de<br>
 France et de Navarre."</p>

<p>Godard [re-entering]. "Tell what it is at once, and don't keep
people<br>
 waiting."</p>

<p>Colleville [triumphantly unfolding the rest of the paper].
"Listen!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A H. V. il cedera;<br>
 De S. C. l. d. partira;<br>
 Eh nauf errera,<br>
 Decide a Gorix.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Every letter is there!" [He repeats it.] "A Henry cinq cedera
(his<br>
 crown of course); de Saint-Cloud partira; en nauf (that's an
old<br>
 French word for skiff, vessel, felucca, corvette, anything you
like)<br>
 errera--"</p>

<p><br>
 Dutocq. "What a tissue of absurdities! How can the King cede his
crown<br>
 to Henry V., who, according to your nonsense, must be his
grandson,<br>
 when Monseigneur le Dauphin is living. Are you prophesying
the<br>
 Dauphin's death?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "What's Gorix, pray?--the name of a cat?"</p>

<p>Colleville [provoked]. "It is the archaeological and
lapidarial<br>
 abbreviation of the name of a town, my good friend; I looked it
out in<br>
 Malte-Brun: Goritz, in Latin Gorixia, situated in Bohemia or
Hungary,<br>
 or it may be Austria--"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Tyrol, the Basque provinces, or South America. Why
don't you<br>
 set it all to music and play it on the clarionet?"</p>

<p>Godard [shrugging his shoulders and departing]. "What utter
nonsense!"</p>

<p>Colleville. "Nonsense! nonsense indeed! It is a pity you don't
take<br>
 the trouble to study fatalism, the religion of the Emperor
Napoleon."</p>

<p>Godard [irritated at Colleville's tone]. "Monsieur Colleville,
let me<br>
 tell you that Bonaparte may perhaps be styled Emperor by
historians,<br>
 but it is extremely out of place to refer to him as such in
a<br>
 government office."</p>

<p>Bixiou [laughing]. "Get an anagram out of that, my dear
fellow."</p>

<p>Colleville [angrily]. "Let me tell you that if Napoleon
Bonaparte had<br>
 studied the letters of his name on the 14th of April, 1814, he
might<br>
 perhaps be Emperor still."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "How do you make that out?"</p>

<p>Colleville [solemnly]. "Napoleon Bonaparte.--No, appear not at
Elba!"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "You'll lose your place for talking such
nonsense."</p>

<p>Colleville. "If my place is taken from me, Francois Keller
will make<br>
 it hot for your minister." [Dead silence.] "I'd have you to
know,<br>
 Master Dutocq, that all known anagrams have actually come to
pass.<br>
 Look here,--you, yourself,--don't you marry, for there's 'coqu'
in<br>
 your name."</p>

<p>Bixiou [interrupting]. "And d, t, for de-testable."</p>

<p>Dutocq [without seeming angry]. "I don't care, as long as it
is only<br>
 in my name. Why don't you anagrammatize, or whatever you call
it,<br>
 'Xavier Rabourdin, chef du bureau'?"</p>

<p>Colleville. "Bless you, so I have!"</p>

<p>Bixiou [mending his pen]. "And what did you make of it?"</p>

<p>Colleville. "It comes out as follows: D'abord reva bureaux,
E-u,--(you<br>
 catch the meaning? et eut--and had) E-u fin riche; which
signifies<br>
 that after first belonging to the administration, he gave it up
and<br>
 got rich elsewhere." [Repeats.] "D'abord reva bureaux, E-u fin
riche."</p>

<p>Dutocq. "That IS queer!"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Try Isidore Baudoyer."</p>

<p>Colleville [mysteriously]. "I sha'n't tell the other anagrams
to any<br>
 one but Thuillier."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "I'll bet you a breakfast that I can tell that one
myself."</p>

<p>Colleville. "And I'll pay if you find it out."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Then I shall breakfast at your expense; but you won't
be<br>
 angry, will you? Two such geniuses as you and I need never
conflict.<br>
 'Isidore Baudoyer' anagrams into 'Ris d'aboyeur d'oie.'"</p>

<p>Colleville [petrified with amazement]. "You stole it from
me!"</p>

<p>Bixiou [with dignity]. "Monsieur Colleville, do me the honor
to<br>
 believe that I am rich enough in absurdity not to steal my
neighbor's<br>
 nonsense."</p>

<p>Baudoyer [entering with a bundle of papers in his hand].
"Gentlemen, I<br>
 request you to shout a little louder; you bring this office into
such<br>
 high repute with the administration. My worthy coadjutor,
Monsieur<br>
 Clergeot, did me the honor just now to come and ask a question,
and he<br>
 heard the noise you are making" [passes into Monsieur Godard's
room].</p>

<p>Bixiou [in a low voice]. "The watch-dog is very tame this
morning;<br>
 there'll be a change of weather before night."</p>

<p>Dutocq [whispering to Bixiou]. "I have something I want to say
to<br>
 you."</p>

<p>Bixiou [fingering Dutocq's waistcoat]. "You've a pretty
waistcoat,<br>
 that cost you nothing; is that what you want to say?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Nothing, indeed! I never paid so dear for anything in
my<br>
 life. That stuff cost six francs a yard in the best shop in the
rue de<br>
 la Paix,--a fine dead stuff, the very thing for deep
mourning."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "You know about engravings and such things, my dear
fellow,<br>
 but you are totally ignorant of the laws of etiquette. Well, no
man<br>
 can be a universal genius! Silk is positively not admissible in
deep<br>
 mourning. Don't you see I am wearing woollen? Monsieur
Rabourdin,<br>
 Monsieur Baudoyer, and the minister are all in woollen; so is
the<br>
 faubourg Saint-Germain. There's no one here but Minard who
doesn't<br>
 wear woollen; he's afraid of being taken for a sheep. That's
the<br>
 reason why he didn't put on mourning for Louis XVIII."</p>

<p>[During this conversation Baudoyer is sitting by the fire in
Godard's<br>
 room, and the two are conversing in a low voice.]</p>

<p>Baudoyer. "Yes, the worthy man is dying. The two ministers are
both<br>
 with him. My father-in-law has been notified of the event. If
you want<br>
 to do me a signal service you will take a cab and go and let
Madame<br>
 Baudoyer know what is happening; for Monsieur Saillard can't
leave his<br>
 desk, nor I my office. Put yourself at my wife's orders; do
whatever<br>
 she wishes. She has, I believe, some ideas of her own, and wants
to<br>
 take certain steps simultaneously." [The two functionaries go
out<br>
 together.]</p>

<p>Godard. "Monsieur Bixiou, I am obliged to leave the office for
the<br>
 rest of the day. You will take my place."</p>

<p>Baudoyer [to Bixiou, benignly]. "Consult me, if there is
any<br>
 necessity."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "This time, La Billardiere is really dead."</p>

<p>Dutocq [in Bixiou's ear]. "Come outside a minute." [The two go
into<br>
 the corridor and gaze at each other like birds of ill-omen.]</p>

<p>Dutocq [whispering]. "Listen. Now is the time for us to
understand<br>
 each other and push our way. What would you say to your being
made<br>
 head of the bureau, and I under you?"</p>

<p>Bixiou [shrugging his shoulders]. "Come, come, don't talk
nonsense!"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "If Baudoyer gets La Billardiere's place Rabourdin
won't stay<br>
 on where he is. Between ourselves, Baudoyer is so incapable that
if du<br>
 Bruel and you don't help him he will certainly be dismissed in
a<br>
 couple of months. If I know arithmetic that will give three
empty<br>
 places for us to fill--"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Three places right under our noses, which will
certainly be<br>
 given to some bloated favorite, some spy, some pious
fraud,--to<br>
 Colleville perhaps, whose wife has ended where all pretty women
end--<br>
 in piety."</p>

<p>Dutocq. "No, to YOU, my dear fellow, if you will only, for
once in<br>
 your life, use your wits logically." [He stopped as if to study
the<br>
 effect of his adverb in Bixiou's face.] "Come, let us play
fair."</p>

<p>Bixiou [stolidly]. "Let me see your game."</p>

<p>Dutocq. "I don't wish to be anything more than
under-head-clerk. I<br>
 know myself perfectly well, and I know I haven't the ability,
like<br>
 you, to be head of a bureau. Du Bruel can be director, and you
the<br>
 head of this bureau; he will leave you his place as soon as he
has<br>
 made his pile; and as for me, I shall swim with the tide
comfortably,<br>
 under your protection, till I can retire on a pension."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Sly dog! but how to you expect to carry out a plan
which<br>
 means forcing the minister's hand and ejecting a man of
talent?<br>
 Between ourselves, Rabourdin is the only man capable of taking
charge<br>
 of the division, and I might say of the ministry. Do you know
that<br>
 they talk of putting in over his head that solid lump of
foolishness,<br>
 that cube of idiocy, Baudoyer?"</p>

<p>Dutocq [consequentially]. "My dear fellow, I am in a position
to rouse<br>
 the whole division against Rabourdin. You know how devoted
Fleury is<br>
 to him? Well, I can make Fleury despise him."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Despised by Fleury!"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Not a soul will stand by Rabourdin; the clerks will
go in a<br>
 body and complain of him to the minister,--not only in our
division,<br>
 but in all the divisions--"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Forward, march! infantry, cavalry, artillery, and
marines of<br>
 the guard! You rave, my good fellow! And I, what part am I to
take in<br>
 the business?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "You are to make a cutting caricature,--sharp enough
to kill a<br>
 man."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "How much will you pay for it?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "A hundred francs."</p>

<p>Bixiou [to himself]. "Then there is something in it."</p>

<p>Dutocq [continuing]. "You must represent Rabourdin dressed as
a<br>
 butcher (make it a good likeness), find analogies between a
kitchen<br>
 and a bureau, put a skewer in his hand, draw portraits of
the<br>
 principal clerks and stick their heads on fowls, put them in
a<br>
 monstrous coop labelled 'Civil Service executions'; make him
cutting<br>
 the throat of one, and supposed to take the others in turn. You
can<br>
 have geese and ducks with heads like ours,--you understand!
Baudoyer,<br>
 for instance, he'll make an excellent turkey-buzzard."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Ris d'aboyeur d'oie!" [He has watched Dutocq
carefully for<br>
 some time.] "Did you think of that yourself?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Yes, I myself."</p>

<p>Bixiou [to himself]. "Do evil feelings bring men to the same
result as<br>
 talents?" [Aloud] "Well, I'll do it" [Dutocq makes a motion
of<br>
 delight] "--when" [full stop] "--I know where I am and what I
can rely<br>
 on. If you don't succeed I shall lose my place, and I must make
a<br>
 living. You are a curious kind of innocent still, my dear
colleague."</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Well, you needn't make the lithograph till success
is<br>
 proved."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Why don't you come out and tell me the whole
truth?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "I must first see how the land lays in the bureau; we
will<br>
 talk about it later" [goes off].</p>

<p>Bixiou [alone in the corridor]. "That fish, for he's more a
fish than<br>
 a bird, that Dutocq has a good idea in his head--I'm sure I
don't know<br>
 where he stole it. If Baudoyer should succeed La Billardiere it
would<br>
 be fun, more than fun--profit!" [Returns to the office.]
"Gentlemen, I<br>
 announce glorious changes; papa La Billardiere is dead, really
dead,--<br>
 no nonsense, word of honor! Godard is off on business for
our<br>
 excellent chief Baudoyer, successor presumptive to the
deceased."<br>
 [Minard, Desroys, and Colleville raise their heads in amazement;
they<br>
 all lay down their pens, and Colleville blows his nose.] "Every
one of<br>
 us is to be promoted! Colleville will be under-head-clerk at the
very<br>
 least. Minard may have my place as chief clerk--why not? he is
quite<br>
 as dull as I am. Hey, Minard, if you should get twenty-five
hundred<br>
 francs a-year your little wife would be uncommonly pleased, and
you<br>
 could buy yourself a pair of boots now and then."</p>

<p>Colleville. "But you don't get twenty-five hundred
francs."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Monsieur Dutocq gets that in Rabourdin's office;
why<br>
 shouldn't I get it this year? Monsieur Baudoyer gets it."</p>

<p>Colleville. "Only through the influence of Monsieur Saillard.
No other<br>
 chief clerk gets that in any of the divisions."</p>

<p>Paulmier. "Bah! Hasn't Monsieur Cochin three thousand? He
succeeded<br>
 Monsieur Vavasseur, who served ten years under the Empire at
four<br>
 thousand. His salary was dropped to three when the King
first<br>
 returned; then to two thousand five hundred before Vavasseur
died. But<br>
 Monsieur Cochin, who succeeded him, had influence enough to get
the<br>
 salary put back to three thousand."</p>

<p>Colleville. "Monsieur Cochin signs E. A. L. Cochin (he is
named Emile-<br>
 Adolphe-Lucian), which, when anagrammed, gives Cochineal. Now
observe,<br>
 he's a partner in a druggist's business in the rue des Lombards,
the<br>
 Maison Matifat, which made its fortune by that identical
colonial<br>
 product."</p>

<p>Baudoyer [entering]. "Monsieur Chazelle, I see, is not here;
you will<br>
 be good enough to say I asked for him, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Bixiou [who had hastily stuck a hat on Chazelle's chair when
he heard<br>
 Baudoyer's step]. "Excuse me, Monsieur, but Chazelle has gone to
the<br>
 Rabourdins' to make an inquiry."</p>

<p>Chazelle [entering with his hat on his head, and not seeing
Baudoyer].<br>
 "La Billardiere is done for, gentlemen! Rabourdin is head of
the<br>
 division and Master of petitions; he hasn't stolen HIS
promotion,<br>
 that's very certain."</p>

<p>Baudoyer [to Chazelle]. "You found that appointment in your
second<br>
 hat, I presume" [points to the hat on the chair]. "This is the
third<br>
 time within a month that you have come after nine o'clock. If
you<br>
 continue the practice you will get on--elsewhere." [To Bixiou,
who is<br>
 reading the newspaper.] "My dear Monsieur Bixiou, do pray leave
the<br>
 newspapers to these gentlemen who are going to breakfast, and
come<br>
 into my office for your orders for the day. I don't know what
Monsieur<br>
 Rabourdin wants with Gabriel; he keeps him to do his private
errands,<br>
 I believe. I've rung three times and can't get him." [Baudoyer
and<br>
 Bixiou retire into the private office.]</p>

<p>Chazelle. "Damned unlucky!"</p>

<p>Paulmier [delighted to annoy Chazelle]. "Why didn't you look
about<br>
 when you came into the room? You might have seen the elephant,
and the<br>
 hat too; they are big enough to be visible."</p>

<p>Chazelle [dismally]. "Disgusting business! I don't see why we
should<br>
 be treated like slaves because the government gives us four
francs and<br>
 sixty-five centimes a day."</p>

<p>Fleury [entering]. "Down with Baudoyer! hurrah for
Rabourdin!--that's<br>
 the cry in the division."</p>

<p>Chazelle [getting more and more angry]. "Baudoyer can turn off
me if<br>
 he likes, I sha'n't care. In Paris there are a thousand ways
of<br>
 earning five francs a day; why, I could earn that at the Palais
de<br>
 Justice, copying briefs for the lawyers."</p>

<p>Paulmier [still prodding him]. "It is very easy to say that;
but a<br>
 government place is a government place, and that plucky
Colleville,<br>
 who works like a galley-slave outside of this office, and who
could<br>
 earn, if he lost his appointment, more than his salary, prefers
to<br>
 keep his place. Who the devil is fool enough to give up his<br>
 expectations?"</p>

<p>Chazelle [continuing his philippic]. "You may not be, but I
am! We<br>
 have no chances at all. Time was when nothing was more
encouraging<br>
 than a civil-service career. So many men were in the army that
there<br>
 were not enough for the government work; the maimed and the halt
and<br>
 the sick ones, like Paulmier, and the near-sighted ones, all had
their<br>
 chance of a rapid promotion. But now, ever since the Chamber
invented<br>
 what they called special training, and the rules and regulations
for<br>
 civil-service examiners, we are worse off than common soldiers.
The<br>
 poorest places are at the mercy of a thousand mischances because
we<br>
 are now ruled by a thousand sovereigns."</p>

<p><br>
 Bixiou [returning]. "Are you crazy, Chazelle? Where do you find
a<br>
 thousand sovereigns?--not in your pocket, are they?"</p>

<p>Chazelle. "Count them up. There are four hundred over there at
the end<br>
 of the pont de la Concorde (so called because it leads to the
scene of<br>
 perpetual discord between the Right and Left of the Chamber);
three<br>
 hundred more at the end of the rue de Tournon. The court, which
ought<br>
 to count for the other three hundred, has seven hundred parts
less<br>
 power to get a man appointed to a place under government than
the<br>
 Emperor Napoleon had."</p>

<p>Fleury. "All of which signifies that in a country where there
are<br>
 three powers you may bet a thousand to one that a government
clerk who<br>
 has no influence but his own merits to advance him will remain
in<br>
 obscurity."</p>

<p>Bixiou [looking alternately at Chazelle and Fleury]. "My sons,
you<br>
 have yet to learn that in these days the worst state of life is
the<br>
 state of belonging to the State."</p>

<p>Fleury. "Because it has a constitutional government."</p>

<p>Colleville. "Gentlemen, gentlemen! no politics!"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Fleury is right. Serving the State in these days is
no longer<br>
 serving a prince who knew how to punish and reward. The State
now is<br>
 EVERYBODY. Everybody of course cares for nobody. Serve
everybody, and<br>
 you serve nobody. Nobody is interested in nobody; the government
clerk<br>
 lives between two negations. The world has neither pity nor
respect,<br>
 neither heart nor head; everybody forgets to-morrow the service
of<br>
 yesterday. Now each one of you may be, like Monsieur Baudoyer,
an<br>
 administrative genius, a Chateaubriand of reports, a Bossouet
of<br>
 circulars, the Canalis of memorials, the gifted son of
diplomatic<br>
 despatches; but I tell you there is a fatal law which interferes
with<br>
 all administrative genius,--I mean the law of promotion by
average.<br>
 This average is based on the statistics of promotion and the<br>
 statistics of mortality combined. It is very certain that on
entering<br>
 whichever section of the Civil Service you please at the age
of<br>
 eighteen, you can't get eighteen hundred francs a year till you
reach<br>
 the age of thirty. Now there's no free and independent career
in<br>
 which, in the course of twelve years, a young man who has gone
through<br>
 the grammar-school, been vaccinated, is exempt from military
service,<br>
 and possesses all his faculties (I don't mean transcendent ones)
can't<br>
 amass a capital of forty-five thousand francs in centimes,
which<br>
 represents a permanent income equal to our salaries, which are,
after<br>
 all, precarious. In twelve years a grocer can earn enough to
give him<br>
 ten thousand francs a year; a painter can daub a mile of canvas
and be<br>
 decorated with the Legion of honor, or pose as a neglected
genius. A<br>
 literary man becomes professor of something or other, or a
journalist<br>
 at a hundred francs for a thousand lines; he writes
"feuilletons," or<br>
 he gets into Saint-Pelagie for a brilliant article that offends
the<br>
 Jesuits,--which of course is an immense benefit to him and makes
him a<br>
 politician at once. Even a lazy man, who does nothing but make
debts,<br>
 has time to marry a widow who pays them; a priest finds time to
become<br>
 a bishop "in partibus." A sober, intelligent young fellow, who
begins<br>
 with a small capital as a money-changer, soon buys a share in
a<br>
 broker's business; and, to go even lower, a petty clerk becomes
a<br>
 notary, a rag-picker lays by two or three thousand francs a
year, and<br>
 the poorest workmen often become manufacturers; whereas, in
the<br>
 rotatory movement of this present civilization, which
mistakes<br>
 perpetual division and redivision for progress, an unhappy
civil<br>
 service clerk, like Chazelle for instance, is forced to dine
for<br>
 twenty-two sous a meal, struggles with his tailor and bootmaker,
gets<br>
 into debt, and is an absolute nothing; worse than that, he
becomes an<br>
 idiot! Come, gentlemen, now's the time to make a stand! Let us
all<br>
 give in our resignations! Fleury, Chazelle, fling yourselves
into<br>
 other employments and become the great men you really are."</p>

<p>Chazelle [calmed down by Bixiou's allocution]. "No, I thank
you"<br>
 [general laughter].</p>

<p>Bixiou. "You are wrong; in your situation I should try to get
ahead of<br>
 the general-secretary."</p>

<p>Chazelle [uneasily]. "What has he to do with me?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "You'll find out; do you suppose Baudoyer will
overlook what<br>
 happened just now?"</p>

<p>Fleury. "Another piece of Bixiou's spite! You've a queer
fellow to<br>
 deal with in there. Now, Monsieur Rabourdin,--there's a man for
you!<br>
 He put work on my table to-day that you couldn't get through
within<br>
 this office in three days; well, he expects me to have it done
by four<br>
 o'clock to-day. But he is not always at my heels to hinder me
from<br>
 talking to my friends."</p>

<p>Baudoyer [appearing at the door]. "Gentlemen, you will admit
that if<br>
 you have the legal right to find fault with the chamber and
the<br>
 administration you must at least do so elsewhere than in this
office."<br>
 [To Fleury.] "What are you doing here, monsieur?"</p>

<p>Fleury [insolently]. "I came to tell these gentlemen that
there was to<br>
 be a general turn-out. Du Bruel is sent for to the ministry,
and<br>
 Dutocq also. Everybody is asking who will be appointed."</p>

<p>Baudoyer [retiring]. "It is not your affair, sir; go back to
your own<br>
 office, and do not disturb mine."</p>

<p>Fleury [in the doorway]. "It would be a shameful injustice
if<br>
 Rabourdin lost the place; I swear I'd leave the service. Did you
find<br>
 that anagram, papa Colleville?"</p>

<p>Colleville. "Yes, here it is."</p>

<p>Fleury [leaning over Colleville's desk]. "Capital! famous!
This is<br>
 just what will happen if the administration continues to play
the<br>
 hypocrite." [He makes a sign to the clerks that Baudoyer is<br>
 listening.] "If the government would frankly state its
intentions<br>
 without concealments of any kind, the liberals would know what
they<br>
 had to deal with. An administration which sets its best
friends<br>
 against itself, such men as those of the 'Debats,'
Chateaubriand, and<br>
 Royer-Collard, is only to be pitied!"</p>

<p>Colleville [after consulting his colleagues]. "Come, Fleury,
you're a<br>
 good fellow, but don't talk politics here; you don't know what
harm<br>
 you may do us."</p>

<p>Fleury [dryly]. "Well, adieu, gentlemen; I have my work to do
by four<br>
 o'clock."</p>

<p>While this idle talk had been going on, des Lupeaulx was
closeted in<br>
 his office with du Bruel, where, a little later, Dutocq joined
them.<br>
 Des Lupeaulx had heard from his valet of La Billardiere's death,
and<br>
 wishing to please the two ministers, he wanted an obituary
article to<br>
 appear in the evening papers.</p>

<p>"Good morning, my dear du Bruel," said the semi-minister to
the head-<br>
 clerk as he entered, and not inviting him to sit down. "You have
heard<br>
 the news? La Billardiere is dead. The ministers were both
present when<br>
 he received the last sacraments. The worthy man strongly
recommended<br>
 Rabourdin, saying he should die with less regret if he could
know that<br>
 his successor were the man who had so constantly done his work.
Death<br>
 is a torture which makes a man confess everything. The minister
agreed<br>
 the more readily because his intention and that of the Council
was to<br>
 reward Monsieur Rabourdin's numerous services. In fact, the
Council of<br>
 State needs his experience. They say that young La Billardiere
is to<br>
 leave the division of his father and go to the Commission of
Seals;<br>
 that's just the same as if the King had made him a present of
a<br>
 hundred thousand francs,--the place can always be sold. But I
know the<br>
 news will delight your division, which will thus get rid of him.
Du<br>
 Bruel, we must get ten or a dozen lines about the worthy late
director<br>
 into the papers; his Excellency will glance them over,--he reads
the<br>
 papers. Do you know the particulars of old La Billardiere's
life?"</p>

<p>Du Bruel made a sign in the negative.</p>

<p>"No?" continued des Lupeaulx. "Well then; he was mixed up in
the<br>
 affairs of La Vendee, and he was one of the confidants of the
late<br>
 King. Like Monsieur le Comte de Fontaine he always refused to
hold<br>
 communication with the First Consul. He was a bit of a 'chouan';
born<br>
 in Brittany of a parliamentary family, and ennobled by Louis
XVIII.<br>
 How old was he? never mind about that; just say his loyalty
was<br>
 untarnished, his religion enlightened,--the poor old fellow
hated<br>
 churches and never set foot in one, but you had better make him
out a<br>
 'pious vassal.' Bring in, gracefully, that he sang the song of
Simeon<br>
 at the accession of Charles X. The Comte d'Artois thought very
highly<br>
 of La Billardiere, for he co-operated in the unfortunate affair
of<br>
 Quiberon and took the whole responsibility on himself. You know
about<br>
 that, don't you? La Billardiere defended the King in a
printed<br>
 pamphlet in reply to an impudent history of the Revolution
written by<br>
 a journalist; you can allude to his loyalty and devotion. But be
very<br>
 careful what you say; weigh your words, so that the other
newspapers<br>
 can't laugh at us; and bring me the article when you've written
it.<br>
 Were you at Rabourdin's yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monseigneur," said du Bruel, "Ah! beg pardon."</p>

<p>"No harm done," answered des Lupeaulx, laughing.</p>

<p>"Madame Rabourdin looked delightfully handsome," added du
Bruel.<br>
 "There are not two women like her in Paris. Some are as clever
as she,<br>
 but there's not one so gracefully witty. Many women may even
be<br>
 handsomer, but it would be hard to find one with such variety
of<br>
 beauty. Madame Rabourdin is far superior to Madame Colleville,"
said<br>
 the vaudevillist, remembering des Lupeaulx's former affair.
"Flavie<br>
 owes what she is to the men about her, whereas Madame Rabourdin
is all<br>
 things in herself. It is wonderful too what she knows; you can't
tell<br>
 secrets in Latin before HER. If I had such a wife, I know I
should<br>
 succeed in everything."</p>

<p>"You have more mind than an author ought to have," returned
des<br>
 Lupeaulx, with a conceited air. Then he turned round and
perceived<br>
 Dutocq. "Ah, good-morning, Dutocq," he said. "I sent for you to
lend<br>
 me your Charlet--if you have the whole complete. Madame la
comtesse<br>
 knows nothing of Charlet."</p>

<p>Du Bruel retired.</p>

<p>"Why do you come in without being summoned?" said des
Lupeaulx,<br>
 harshly, when he and Dutocq were left alone. "Is the State in
danger<br>
 that you must come here at ten o'clock in the morning, just as I
am<br>
 going to breakfast with his Excellency?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is, monsieur," said Dutocq, dryly. "If I had had
the honor<br>
 to see you earlier, you would probably have not been so willing
to<br>
 support Monsieur Rabourdin, after reading his opinion of
you."</p>

<p>Dutocq opened his coat, took a paper from the left-hand
breast-pocket<br>
 and laid it on des Lupeaulx's desk, pointing to a marked
passage. Then<br>
 he went to the door and slipped the bolt, fearing interruption.
While<br>
 he was thus employed, the secretary-general read the opening
sentence<br>
 of the article, which was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Monsieur des Lupeaulx. A government degrades itself by
openly<br>
 employing such a man, whose real vocation is for police
diplomacy.<br>
 He is fitted to deal with the political filibusters of other<br>
 cabinets, and it would be a pity therefore to employ him on
our<br>
 internal detective police. He is above a common spy, for he
is<br>
 able to understand a plan; he could skilfully carry through a
dark<br>
 piece of work and cover his retreat safely."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Des Lupeaulx was succinctly analyzed in five or six such
paragraphs,--<br>
 the essence, in fact, of the biographical portrait which we gave
at<br>
 the beginning of this history. As he read the words the
secretary felt<br>
 that a man stronger than himself sat in judgment on him; and he
at<br>
 once resolved to examine the memorandum, which evidently reached
far<br>
 and high, without allowing Dutocq to know his secret thoughts.
He<br>
 therefore showed a calm, grave face when the spy returned to
him. Des<br>
 Lupeaulx, like lawyers, magistrates, diplomatists, and all whose
work<br>
 obliges them to pry into the human heart, was past being
surprised at<br>
 anything. Hardened in treachery and in all the tricks and wiles
of<br>
 hatred, he could take a stab in the back and not let his face
tell of<br>
 it.</p>

<p><br>
 "How did you get hold of this paper?"</p>

<p>Dutocq related his good luck; des Lupeaulx's face as he
listened<br>
 expressed no approbation; and the spy ended in terror an account
which<br>
 began triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Dutocq, you have put your finger between the bark and the
tree," said<br>
 the secretary, coldly. "If you don't want to make powerful
enemies I<br>
 advise you to keep this paper a profound secret; it is a work of
the<br>
 utmost importance and already well known to me."</p>

<p>So saying, des Lupeaulx dismissed Dutocq by one of those
glances that<br>
 are more expressive than words.</p>

<p>"Ha! that scoundrel of a Rabourdin has put his finger in
this!"<br>
 thought Dutocq, alarmed on finding himself anticipated; "he
has<br>
 reached the ear of the administration, while I am left out in
the<br>
 cold. I shouldn't have thought it!"</p>

<p>To all his other motives of aversion to Rabourdin he now added
the<br>
 jealousy of one man to another man of the same calling,--a
most<br>
 powerful ingredient in hatred.</p>

<p>When des Lupeaulx was left alone, he dropped into a
strange<br>
 meditation. What power was it of which Rabourdin was the
instrument?<br>
 Should he, des Lupeaulx, use this singular document to destroy
him, or<br>
 should he keep it as a weapon to succeed with the wife? The
mystery<br>
 that lay behind this paper was all darkness to des Lupeaulx, who
read<br>
 with something akin to terror page after page, in which the men
of his<br>
 acquaintance were judged with unerring wisdom. He admired
Rabourdin,<br>
 though stabbed to his vitals by what he said of him. The
breakfast-<br>
 hour suddenly cut short his meditation.</p>

<p>"His Excellency is waiting for you to come down," announced
the<br>
 minister's footman.</p>

<p>The minister always breakfasted with his wife and children and
des<br>
 Lupeaulx, without the presence of servants. The morning meal
affords<br>
 the only moment of privacy which public men can snatch from
the<br>
 current of overwhelming business. Yet in spite of the
precautions they<br>
 take to keep this hour for private intimacies and affections, a
good<br>
 many great and little people manage to infringe upon it.
Business<br>
 itself will, as at this moment, thrust itself in the way of
their<br>
 scanty comfort.</p>

<p>"I thought Rabourdin was a man above all ordinary petty
manoeuvres,"<br>
 began the minister; "and yet here, not ten minutes after La<br>
 Billardiere's death, he sends me this note by La Briere,--it is
like a<br>
 stage missive. Look," said his Excellency, giving des Lupeaulx a
paper<br>
 which he was twirling in his fingers.</p>

<p>Too noble in mind to think for a moment of the shameful
meaning La<br>
 Billardiere's death might lend to his letter, Rabourdin had
not<br>
 withdrawn it from La Briere's hands after the news reached him.
Des<br>
 Lupeaulx read as follows:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Monseigneur,--If twenty-three years of irreproachable
services<br>
 may claim a favor, I entreat your Excellency to grant me an<br>
 audience this very day. My honor is involved in the matter
of<br>
 which I desire to speak."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Poor man!" said des Lupeaulx, in a tone of compassion which
confirmed<br>
 the minister in his error. "We are alone; I advise you to see
him now.<br>
 You have a meeting of the Council when the Chamber rises;
moreover,<br>
 your Excellency has to reply to-day to the opposition; this is
really<br>
 the only hour when you can receive him."</p>

<p><br>
 Des Lupeaulx rose, called the servant, said a few words, and
returned<br>
 to his seat. "I have told them to bring him in at dessert," he
said.</p>

<p>Like all other ministers under the Restoration, this
particular<br>
 minister was a man without youth. The charter granted by Louis
XVIII.<br>
 had the defect of tying the hands of the kings by compelling
them to<br>
 deliver the destinies of the nation into the control of the
middle-<br>
 aged men of the Chamber and the septuagenarians of the peerage;
it<br>
 robbed them of the right to lay hands on a man of statesmanlike
talent<br>
 wherever they could find him, no matter how young he was or
how<br>
 poverty-stricken his condition might be. Napoleon alone was able
to<br>
 employ young men as he chose, without being restrained by
any<br>
 consideration. After the overthrow of that mighty will, vigor
deserted<br>
 power. Now the period when effeminacy succeeds to vigor presents
a<br>
 contrast that is far more dangerous in France than in other
countries.<br>
 As a general thing, ministers who were old before they entered
office<br>
 have proved second or third rate, while those who were taken
young<br>
 have been an honor to European monarchies and to the republics
whose<br>
 affairs they have directed. The world still rings with the
struggle<br>
 between Pitt and Napoleon, two men who conducted the politics of
their<br>
 respective countries at an age when Henri de Navarre,
Richelieu,<br>
 Mazarin, Colbert, Louvois, the Prince of Orange, the Guises,<br>
 Machiavelli, in short, all the best known of our great men,
coming<br>
 from the ranks or born to a throne, began to rule the State.
The<br>
 Convention--that model of energy--was made up in a great measure
of<br>
 young heads; no sovereign can ever forget that it was able to
put<br>
 fourteen armies into the field against Europe. Its policy, fatal
in<br>
 the eyes of those who cling to what is called absolute power,
was<br>
 nevertheless dictated by strictly monarchical principles, and
it<br>
 behaved itself like any of the great kings.</p>

<p>After ten or a dozen years of parliamentary struggle, having
studied<br>
 the science of politics until he was worn down by it, this
particular<br>
 minister had come to be enthroned by his party, who considered
him in<br>
 the light of their business man. Happily for him he was now
nearer<br>
 sixty than fifty years of age; had he retained even a vestige
of<br>
 juvenile vigor he would quickly have quenched it. But,
accustomed to<br>
 back and fill, retreat and return to the charge, he was able to
endure<br>
 being struck at, turn and turn about, by his own party, by
the<br>
 opposition, by the court, by the clergy, because to all such
attacks<br>
 he opposed the inert force of a substance which was equally soft
and<br>
 consistent; thus he reaped the benefits of what was really
his<br>
 misfortune. Harassed by a thousand questions of government, his
mind,<br>
 like that of an old lawyer who has tried every species of case,
no<br>
 longer possessed the spring which solitary minds are able to
retain,<br>
 nor that power of prompt decision which distinguishes men who
are<br>
 early accustomed to action, and young soldiers. How could it
be<br>
 otherwise? He had practised sophistries and quibbled instead
of<br>
 judging; he had criticised effects and done nothing for causes;
his<br>
 head was full of plans such as a political party lays upon
the<br>
 shoulders of a leader,--matters of private interest brought to
an<br>
 orator supposed to have a future, a jumble of schemes and
impractical<br>
 requests. Far from coming fresh to his work, he was wearied out
with<br>
 marching and counter-marching, and when he finally reached the
much<br>
 desired height of his present position, he found himself in a
thicket<br>
 of thorny bushes with a thousand conflicting wills to
conciliate. If<br>
 the statesmen of the Restoration had been allowed to follow out
their<br>
 own ideas, their capacity would doubtless have been criticised;
but<br>
 though their wills were often forced, their age saved them
from<br>
 attempting the resistance which youth opposes to intrigues, both
high<br>
 and low,--intrigues which vanquished Richelieu, and to which, in
a<br>
 lower sphere, Rabourdin was to succumb.</p>

<p>After the rough and tumble of their first struggles in
political life<br>
 these men, less old than aged, have to endure the additional
wear and<br>
 tear of a ministry. Thus it is that their eyes begin to weaken
just as<br>
 they need to have the clear-sightedness of eagles; their mind is
weary<br>
 when its youth and fire need to be redoubled. The minister in
whom<br>
 Rabourdin sought to confide was in the habit of listening to men
of<br>
 undoubted superiority as they explained ingenious theories
of<br>
 government, applicable or inapplicable to the affairs of France.
Such<br>
 men, by whom the difficulties of national policy were never<br>
 apprehended, were in the habit of attacking this minister
personally<br>
 whenever a parliamentary battle or a contest with the secret
follies<br>
 of the court took place,--on the eve of a struggle with the
popular<br>
 mind, or on the morrow of a diplomatic discussion which divided
the<br>
 Council into three separate parties. Caught in such a
predicament, a<br>
 statesman naturally keeps a yawn ready for the first sentence
designed<br>
 to show him how the public service could be better managed. At
such<br>
 periods not a dinner took place among bold schemers or financial
and<br>
 political lobbyists where the opinions of the Bourse and the
Bank, the<br>
 secrets of diplomacy, and the policy necessitated by the state
of<br>
 affairs in Europe were not canvassed and discussed. The minister
has<br>
 his own private councillors in des Lupeaulx and his secretary,
who<br>
 collected and pondered all opinions and discussions for the
purpose of<br>
 analyzing and controlling the various interests proclaimed
and<br>
 supported by so many clever men. In fact, his misfortune was
that of<br>
 most other ministers who have passed the prime of life; he
trimmed and<br>
 shuffled under all his difficulties,--with journalism, which at
this<br>
 period it was thought advisable to repress in an underhand way
rather<br>
 than fight openly; with financial as well as labor questions;
with the<br>
 clergy as well as with that other question of the public lands;
with<br>
 liberalism as with the Chamber. After manoeuvering his way to
power in<br>
 the course of seven years, the minister believed that he could
manage<br>
 all questions of administration in the same way. It is so
natural to<br>
 think we can maintain a position by the same methods which
served us<br>
 to reach it that no one ventured to blame a system invented
by<br>
 mediocrity to please minds of its own calibre. The Restoration,
like<br>
 the Polish revolution, proved to nations as to princes the true
value<br>
 of a Man, and what will happen if that necessary man is wanting.
The<br>
 last and the greatest weakness of the public men of the
Restoration<br>
 was their honesty, in a struggle in which their adversaries
employed<br>
 the resources of political dishonesty, lies, and calumnies, and
let<br>
 loose upon them, by all subversive means, the clamor of the<br>
 unintelligent masses, able only to understand revolt.</p>

<p>Rabourdin told himself all these things. But he had made up
his mind<br>
 to win or lose, like a man weary of gambling who allows himself
a last<br>
 stake; ill-luck had given him as adversary in the game a sharper
like<br>
 des Lupeaulx. With all his sagacity, Rabourdin was better versed
in<br>
 matters of administration than in parliamentary optics, and he
was far<br>
 indeed from imagining how his confidence would be received; he
little<br>
 thought that the great work that filled his mind would seem to
the<br>
 minister nothing more than a theory, and that a man who held
the<br>
 position of a statesman would confound his reform with the
schemes of<br>
 political and self-interested talkers.</p>

<p>As the minister rose from table, thinking of Francois Keller,
his wife<br>
 detained him with the offer of a bunch of grapes, and at that
moment<br>
 Rabourdin was announced. Des Lupeaulx had counted on the
minister's<br>
 preoccupation and his desire to get away; seeing him for the
moment<br>
 occupied with his wife, the general-secretary went forward to
meet<br>
 Rabourdin; whom he petrified with his first words, said in a low
tone<br>
 of voice:--</p>

<p>"His Excellency and I know what the subject is that occupies
your<br>
 mind; you have nothing to fear"; then, raising his voice, he
added,<br>
 "neither from Dutocq nor from any one else."</p>

<p>"Don't feel uneasy, Rabourdin," said his Excellency, kindly,
but<br>
 making a movement to get away.</p>

<p>Rabourdin came forward respectfully, and the minister could
not evade<br>
 him.</p>

<p>"Will your Excellency permit me to see you for a moment in
private?"<br>
 he said, with a mysterious glance.</p>

<p>The minister looked at the clock and went towards the window,
whither<br>
 the poor man followed him.</p>

<p>"When may I have the honor of submitting the matter of which I
spoke<br>
 to your Excellency? I desire to fully explain the plan of<br>
 administration to which the paper that was taken belongs--"</p>

<p>"Plan of administration!" exclaimed the minister, frowning,
and<br>
 hurriedly interrupting him. "If you have anything of that kind
to<br>
 communicate you must wait for the regular day when we do
business<br>
 together. I ought to be at the Council now; and I have an answer
to<br>
 make to the Chamber on that point which the opposition raised
before<br>
 the session ended yesterday. Your day is Wednesday next; I could
not<br>
 work yesterday, for I had other things to attend to; political
matters<br>
 are apt to interfere with purely administrative ones."</p>

<p>"I place my honor with all confidence in your Excellency's
hands,"<br>
 said Rabourdin gravely, "and I entreat you to remember that you
have<br>
 not allowed me time to give you an immediate explanation of the
stolen<br>
 paper--"</p>

<p>"Don't be uneasy," said des Lupeaulx, interposing between the
minister<br>
 and Rabourdin, whom he thus interrupted; "in another week you
will<br>
 probably be appointed--"</p>

<p>The minister smiled as he thought of des Lupeaulx's enthusiasm
for<br>
 Madame Rabourdin, and he glanced knowingly at his wife.
Rabourdin saw<br>
 the look, and tried to imagine its meaning; his attention was
diverted<br>
 for a moment, and his Excellency took advantage of the fact to
make<br>
 his escape.</p>

<p>"We will talk of all this, you and I," said des Lupeaulx, with
whom<br>
 Rabourdin, much to his surprise, now found himself alone. "Don't
be<br>
 angry with Dutocq; I'll answer for his discretion."</p>

<p>"Madame Rabourdin is charming," said the minister's wife,
wishing to<br>
 say the civil thing to the head of a bureau.</p>

<p>The children all gazed at Rabourdin with curiosity. The poor
man had<br>
 come there expecting some serious, even solemn, result, and he
was<br>
 like a great fish caught in the threads of a flimsy net; he
struggled<br>
 with himself.</p>

<p>"Madame la comtesse is very good," he said.</p>

<p>"Shall I not have the pleasure of seeing Madame here some
Wednesday?"<br>
 said the countess. "Pray bring her; it will give me
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Madame Rabourdin herself receives on Wednesdays," interrupted
des<br>
 Lupeaulx, who knew the empty civility of an invitation to the
official<br>
 Wednesdays; "but since you are so kind as to wish for her, you
will<br>
 soon give one of your private parties, and--"</p>

<p>The countess rose with some irritation.</p>

<p>"You are the master of my ceremonies," she said to des
Lupeaulx,--<br>
 ambiguous words, by which she expressed the annoyance she felt
with<br>
 the secretary for presuming to interfere with her private
parties, to<br>
 which she admitted only a select few. She left the room without
bowing<br>
 to Rabourdin, who remained alone with des Lupeaulx; the latter
was<br>
 twisting in his fingers the confidential letter to the minister
which<br>
 Rabourdin had intrusted to La Briere. Rabourdin recognized
it.</p>

<p>"You have never really known me," said des Lupeaulx. "Friday
evening<br>
 we will come to a full understanding. Just now I must go and
receive<br>
 callers; his Excellency saddles me with that burden when he has
other<br>
 matters to attend to. But I repeat, Rabourdin, don't worry
yourself;<br>
 you have nothing to fear."</p>

<p>Rabourdin walked slowly through the corridors, amazed and
confounded<br>
 by this singular turn of events. He had expected Dutocq to
denounce<br>
 him, and found he had not been mistaken; des Lupeaulx had
certainly<br>
 seen the document which judged him so severely, and yet des
Lupeaulx<br>
 was fawning on his judge! It was all incomprehensible. Men of
upright<br>
 minds are often at a loss to understand complicated intrigues,
and<br>
 Rabourdin was lost in a maze of conjecture without being able
to<br>
 discover the object of the game which the secretary was
playing.</p>

<p>"Either he has not read the part about himself, or he loves my
wife."</p>

<p>Such were the two thoughts to which his mind arrived as he
crossed the<br>
 courtyard; for the glance he had intercepted the night before
between<br>
 des Lupeaulx and Celestine came back to his memory like a flash
of<br>
 lightning.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h4>THE WORMS AT WORK</h4>

<p>Rabourdin's bureau was during his absence a prey to the
keenest<br>
 excitement; for the relation between the head officials and the
clerks<br>
 in a government office is so regulated that, when a
minister's<br>
 messenger summons the head of a bureau to his Excellency's
presence<br>
 (above all at the latter's breakfast hour), there is no end to
the<br>
 comments that are made. The fact that the present unusual
summons<br>
 followed so closely on the death of Monsieur de la Billardiere
seemed<br>
 to give special importance to the circumstance, which was made
known<br>
 to Monsieur Saillard, who came at once to confer with
Baudoyer.<br>
 Bixiou, who happened at the moment to be at work with the
latter, left<br>
 him to converse with his father-in-law and betook himself to
the<br>
 bureau Rabourdin, where the usual routine was of course
interrupted.</p>

<p><br>
 Bixiou [entering]. "I thought I should find you at a white heat!
Don't<br>
 you know what's going on down below? The virtuous woman is done
for!<br>
 yes, done for, crushed! Terrible scene at the ministry!"</p>

<p>Dutocq [looking fixedly at him]. "Are you telling the
truth?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Pray, who would regret it? Not you, certainly, for
you will<br>
 be made under-head-clerk and du Bruel head of the bureau.
Monsieur<br>
 Baudoyer gets the division."</p>

<p>Fleury. "I'll bet a hundred francs that Baudoyer will never be
head of<br>
 the division."</p>

<p>Vimeux. "I'll join in the bet; will you, Monsieur Poiret?"</p>

<p>Poiret. "I retire in January."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Is it possible? are we to lose the sight of those
shoe-ties?<br>
 What will the ministry be without you? Will nobody take up the
bet on<br>
 my side?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "I can't, for I know the facts. Monsieur Rabourdin
is<br>
 appointed. Monsieur de la Billardiere requested it of the
two<br>
 ministers on his death-bed, blaming himself for having taken
the<br>
 emoluments of an office of which Rabourdin did all the work; he
felt<br>
 remorse of conscience, and the ministers, to quiet him, promised
to<br>
 appoint Rabourdin unless higher powers intervened."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Gentlemen, are you all against me? seven to one,--for
I know<br>
 which side you'll take, Monsieur Phellion. Well, I'll bet a
dinner<br>
 costing five hundred francs at the Rocher de Cancale that
Rabourdin<br>
 does not get La Billardiere's place. That will cost you only a
hundred<br>
 francs each, and I'm risking five hundred,--five to one against
me! Do<br>
 you take it up?" [Shouting into the next room.] "Du Bruel, what
say<br>
 you?"</p>

<p>Phellion [laying down his pen]. "Monsieur, may I ask on what
you base<br>
 that contingent proposal?--for contingent it is. But stay, I am
wrong<br>
 to call it a proposal; I should say contract. A wager
constitutes a<br>
 contract."</p>

<p>Fleury. "No, no; you can only apply the word 'contract' to
agreements<br>
 that are recognized in the Code. Now the Code allows of no
action for<br>
 the recovery of a bet."</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Proscribe a thing and you recognize it."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Good! my little man."</p>

<p>Poiret. "Dear me!"</p>

<p>Fleury. "True! when one refuses to pay one's debts, that's
recognizing<br>
 them."</p>

<p>Thuillier. "You would make famous lawyers."</p>

<p>Poiret. "I am as curious as Monsieur Phellion to know what
grounds<br>
 Monsieur Bixiou has for--"</p>

<p>Bixiou [shouting across the office]. "Du Bruel! Will you
bet?"</p>

<p>Du Bruel [appearing at the door]. "Heavens and earth,
gentlemen, I'm<br>
 very busy; I have something very difficult to do; I've got to
write an<br>
 obituary notice of Monsieur de la Billardiere. I do beg you to
be<br>
 quiet; you can laugh and bet afterwards."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "That's true, du Bruel; the praise of an honest man is
a very<br>
 difficult thing to write. I'd rather any day draw a caricature
of<br>
 him."</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "Do come and help me, Bixiou."</p>

<p>Bixiou [following him]. "I'm willing; though I can do such
things much<br>
 better when eating."</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "Well, we will go and dine together afterwards. But
listen,<br>
 this is what I have written" [reads] "'The Church and the
Monarchy are<br>
 daily losing many of those who fought for them in
Revolutionary<br>
 times.'"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Bad, very bad; why don't you say, 'Death carries on
its<br>
 ravages amongst the few surviving defenders of the monarchy and
the<br>
 old and faithful servants of the King, whose heart bleeds under
these<br>
 reiterated blows?'" [Du Bruel writes rapidly.] "'Monsieur le
Baron<br>
 Flamet de la Billardiere died this morning of dropsy, caused by
heart<br>
 disease.' You see, it is just as well to show there are hearts
in<br>
 government offices; and you ought to slip in a little flummery
about<br>
 the emotions of the Royalists during the Terror,--might be
useful,<br>
 hey! But stay,--no! the petty papers would be sure to say the
emotions<br>
 came more from the stomach than the heart. Better leave that
out. What<br>
 are you writing now?"</p>

<p>Du Bruel [reading]. "'Issuing from an old parliamentary stock
in which<br>
 devotion to the throne was hereditary, as was also attachment to
the<br>
 faith of our fathers, Monsieur de la Billardiere--'"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Better say Monsieur le Baron de la Billardiere."</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "But he wasn't baron in 1793."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "No matter. Don't you remember that under the Empire
Fouche<br>
 was telling an anecdote about the Convention, in which he had to
quote<br>
 Robespierre, and he said, 'Robespierre called out to me,
"Duc<br>
 d'Otrante, go to the Hotel de Ville."' There's a precedent for
you!"</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "Let me just write that down; I can use it in a
vaudeville.<br>
 --But to go back to what we were saying. I don't want to put
'Monsieur<br>
 le baron,' because I am reserving his honors till the last, when
they<br>
 rained upon him."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Oh! very good; that's theatrical,--the finale of
the<br>
 article."</p>

<p>Du Bruel [continuing]. "'In appointing Monsieur de la
Billardiere<br>
 gentleman-in-ordinary--'"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Very ordinary!"</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "'--of the Bedchamber, the King rewarded not only
the<br>
 services rendered by the Provost, who knew how to harmonize
the<br>
 severity of his functions with the customary urbanity of the
Bourbons,<br>
 but the bravery of the Vendean hero, who never bent the knee to
the<br>
 imperial idol. He leaves a son, who inherits his loyalty and
his<br>
 talents.'"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Don't you think all that is a little too florid? I
should<br>
 tone down the poetry. 'Imperial idol!' 'bent the knee!' damn it,
my<br>
 dear fellow, writing vaudevilles has ruined your style; you
can't come<br>
 down to pedestrial prose. I should say, 'He belonged to the
small<br>
 number of those who.' Simplify, simplify! the man himself was
a<br>
 simpleton."</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "That's vaudeville, if you like! You would make your
fortune<br>
 at the theatre, Bixiou."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "What have you said about Quiberon?" [Reads over du
Bruel's<br>
 shoulder.] "Oh, that won't do! Here, this is what you must say:
'He<br>
 took upon himself, in a book recently published, the
responsibility<br>
 for all the blunders of the expedition to Quiberon,--thus
proving the<br>
 nature of his loyalty, which did not shrink from any
sacrifice.'<br>
 That's clever and witty, and exalts La Billardiere."</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "At whose expense?"</p>

<p>Bixiou [solemn as a priest in a pulpit]. "Why, Hoche and
Tallien, of<br>
 course; don't you read history?"</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "No. I subscribed to the Baudouin series, but I've
never had<br>
 time to open a volume; one can't find matter for vaudevilles
there."</p>

<p>Phellion [at the door]. "We all want to know, Monsieur Bixiou,
what<br>
 made you think that the worthy and honorable Monsieur Rabourdin,
who<br>
 has so long done the work of this division for Monsieur de
la<br>
 Billardiere,--he, who is the senior head of all the bureaus, and
whom,<br>
 moreover, the minister summoned as soon as he heard of the
departure<br>
 of the late Monsieur de la Billardiere,--will not be appointed
head of<br>
 the division."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Papa Phellion, you know geography?"</p>

<p>Phellion [bridling up]. "I should say so!"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "And history?"</p>

<p>Phellion [affecting modesty]. "Possibly."</p>

<p>Bixiou [looking fixedly at him]. "Your diamond pin is loose,
it is<br>
 coming out. Well, you may know all that, but you don't know the
human<br>
 heart; you have gone no further in the geography and history of
that<br>
 organ than you have in the environs of the city of Paris."</p>

<p>Poiret [to Vimeux]. "Environs of Paris? I thought they were
talking of<br>
 Monsieur Rabourdin."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "About that bet? Does the entire bureau Rabourdin bet
against<br>
 me?"</p>

<p>All. "Yes."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Du Bruel, do you count in?"</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "Of course I do. We want Rabourdin to go up a step
and make<br>
 room for others."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Well, I accept the bet,--for this reason; you can
hardly<br>
 understand it, but I'll tell it to you all the same. It would be
right<br>
 and just to appoint Monsieur Rabourdin" [looking full at
Dutocq],<br>
 "because, in that case, long and faithful service, honor, and
talent<br>
 would be recognized, appreciated, and properly rewarded. Such
an<br>
 appointment is in the best interests of the administration."<br>
 [Phellion, Poiret, and Thuillier listen stupidly, with the look
of<br>
 those who try to peer before them in the darkness.] "Well, it is
just<br>
 because the promotion would be so fitting, and because the man
has<br>
 such merit, and because the measure is so eminently wise and
equitable<br>
 that I bet Rabourdin will not be appointed. Yes, you'll see,
that<br>
 appointment will slip up, just like the invasion from Boulogne,
and<br>
 the march to Russia, for the success of which a great genius
has<br>
 gathered together all the chances. It will fail as all good and
just<br>
 things do fail in this low world. I am only backing the devil's
game."</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "Who do you think will be appointed?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "The more I think about Baudoyer, the more sure I feel
that he<br>
 unites all the opposite qualities; therefore I think he will be
the<br>
 next head of this division."</p>

<p>Dutocq. "But Monsieur des Lupeaulx, who sent for me to borrow
my<br>
 Charlet, told me positively that Monsieur Rabourdin was
appointed, and<br>
 that the little La Billardiere would be made Clerk of the
Seals."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Appointed, indeed! The appointment can't be made and
signed<br>
 under ten days. It will certainly not be known before New-Year's
day.<br>
 There he goes now across the courtyard; look at him, and say if
the<br>
 virtuous Rabourdin looks like a man in the sunshine of favor. I
should<br>
 say he knows he's dismissed." [Fleury rushes to the window.]<br>
 "Gentlemen, adieu; I'll go and tell Monsieur Baudoyer that I
hear from<br>
 you that Rabourdin is appointed; it will make him furious, the
pious<br>
 creature! Then I'll tell him of our wager, to cool him
down,--a<br>
 process we call at the theatre turning the Wheel of Fortune,
don't we,<br>
 du Bruel? Why do I care who gets the place? simply because if
Baudoyer<br>
 does he will make me under-head-clerk" [goes out].</p>

<p>Poiret. "Everybody says that man is clever, but as for me, I
can never<br>
 understand a word he says" [goes on copying]. "I listen and
listen; I<br>
 hear words, but I never get at any meaning; he talks about
the<br>
 environs of Paris when he discusses the human heart and" [lays
down<br>
 his pen and goes to the stove] "declares he backs the devil's
game<br>
 when it is a question of Russia and Boulogne; now what is there
so<br>
 clever in that, I'd like to know? We must first admit that the
devil<br>
 plays any game at all, and then find out what game; possibly
dominoes"<br>
 [blows his nose].</p>

<p>Fleury [interrupting]. "Pere Poiret is blowing his nose; it
must be<br>
 eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "So it is! Goodness! I'm off to the secretary; he
wants to<br>
 read the obituary."</p>

<p>Poiret. "What was I saying?"</p>

<p>Thuillier. "Dominoes,--perhaps the devil plays dominoes."
[Sebastien<br>
 enters to gather up the different papers and circulars for
signature.]</p>

<p>Vimeux. "Ah! there you are, my fine young man. Your days of
hardship<br>
 are nearly over; you'll get a post. Monsieur Rabourdin will
be<br>
 appointed. Weren't you at Madame Rabourdin's last night? Lucky
fellow!<br>
 they say that really superb women go there."</p>

<p>Sebastien. "Do they? I didn't know."</p>

<p>Fleury. "Are you blind?"</p>

<p>Sebastien. "I don't like to look at what I ought not to
see."</p>

<p>Phellion [delighted]. "Well said, young man!"</p>

<p>Vimeux. "The devil! well, you looked at Madame Rabourdin
enough, any<br>
 how; a charming woman."</p>

<p>Fleury. "Pooh! thin as a rail. I saw her in the Tuileries, and
I much<br>
 prefer Percilliee, the ballet-mistress, Castaing's victim."</p>

<p>Phellion. "What has an actress to do with the wife of a
government<br>
 official?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "They both play comedy."</p>

<p>Fleury [looking askance at Dutocq]. "The physical has nothing
to do<br>
 with the moral, and if you mean--"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "I mean nothing."</p>

<p>Fleury. "Do you all want to know which of us will really be
made head<br>
 of this bureau?"</p>

<p>All. "Yes, tell us."</p>

<p>Fleury. "Colleville."</p>

<p>Thuillier. "Why?"</p>

<p>Fleury. "Because Madame Colleville has taken the shortest way
to it--<br>
 through the sacristy."</p>

<p>Thuillier. "I am too much Colleville's friend not to beg you,
Monsieur<br>
 Fleury, to speak respectfully of his wife."</p>

<p>Phellion. "A defenceless woman should never be made the
subject of<br>
 conversation here--"</p>

<p>Vimeux. "All the more because the charming Madame Colleville
won't<br>
 invite Fleury to her house. He backbites her in revenge."</p>

<p>Fleury. "She may not receive me on the same footing that she
does<br>
 Thuillier, but I go there--"</p>

<p>Thuillier. "When? how?--under her windows?"</p>

<p>Though Fleury was dreaded as a bully in all the offices, he
received<br>
 Thuillier's speech in silence. This meekness, which surprised
the<br>
 other clerks, was owing to a certain note for two hundred
francs, of<br>
 doubtful value, which Thuillier agreed to pass over to his
sister.<br>
 After this skirmish dead silence prevailed. They all wrote
steadily<br>
 from one to three o'clock. Du Bruel did not return.</p>

<p>About half-past three the usual preparations for departure,
the<br>
 brushing of hats, the changing of coats, went on in all the<br>
 ministerial offices. That precious thirty minutes thus employed
served<br>
 to shorten by just so much the day's labor. At this hour the
over-<br>
 heated rooms cool off; the peculiar odor that hangs about the
bureaus<br>
 evaporates; silence is restored. By four o'clock none but a few
clerks<br>
 who do their duty conscientiously remain. A minister may know
who are<br>
 the real workers under him if he will take the trouble to walk
through<br>
 the divisions after four o'clock,--a species of prying, however,
that<br>
 no one of his dignity would condescend to.</p>

<p>The various heads of divisions and bureaus usually encountered
each<br>
 other in the courtyards at this hour and exchanged opinions on
the<br>
 events of the day. On this occasion they departed by twos and
threes,<br>
 most of them agreeing in favor of Rabourdin; while the old
stagers,<br>
 like Monsieur Clergeot, shook their heads and said, "Habent sua
sidera<br>
 lites." Saillard and Baudoyer were politely avoided, for nobody
knew<br>
 what to say to them about La Billardiere's death, it being
fully<br>
 understood that Baudoyer wanted the place, though it was
certainly not<br>
 due to him.</p>

<p>When Saillard and his son-in-law had gone a certain distance
from the<br>
 ministry the former broke silence and said: "Things look badly
for<br>
 you, my poor Baudoyer."</p>

<p>"I can't understand," replied the other, "what Elisabeth was
dreaming<br>
 of when she sent Godard in such a hurry to get a passport for
Falleix;<br>
 Godard tells me she hired a post-chaise by the advice of my
uncle<br>
 Mitral, and that Falleix has already started for his own part of
the<br>
 country."</p>

<p>"Some matter connected with our business," suggested
Saillard.</p>

<p>"Our most pressing business just now is to look after Monsieur
La<br>
 Billardiere's place," returned Baudoyer, crossly.</p>

<p>They were just then near the entrance of the Palais-Royal on
the rue<br>
 Saint-Honore. Dutocq came up, bowing, and joined them.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he said to Baudoyer, "if I can be useful to you in
any way<br>
 under the circumstances in which you find yourself, pray command
me,<br>
 for I am not less devoted to your interests than Monsieur
Godard."</p>

<p>"Such an assurance is at least consoling," replied Baudoyer;
"it makes<br>
 me aware that I have the confidence of honest men."</p>

<p>"If you would kindly employ your influence to get me placed in
your<br>
 division, taking Bixiou as head of the bureau and me as
under-head-<br>
 clerk, you will secure the future of two men who are ready to
do<br>
 anything for your advancement."</p>

<p>"Are you making fun of us, monsieur?" asked Saillard, staring
at him<br>
 stupidly.</p>

<p>"Far be it from me to do that," said Dutocq. "I have just come
from<br>
 the printing-office of the ministerial journal (where I carried
from<br>
 the general-secretary an obituary notice of Monsieur de la<br>
 Billardiere), and I there read an article which will appear
to-night<br>
 about you, which has given me the highest opinion of your
character<br>
 and talents. If it is necessary to crush Rabourdin, I'm in a
position<br>
 to give him the final blow; please to remember that."</p>

<p>Dutocq disappeared.</p>

<p>"May I be shot if I understand a single word of it," said
Saillard,<br>
 looking at Baudoyer, whose little eyes were expressive of
stupid<br>
 bewilderment. "I must buy the newspaper to-night."</p>

<p>When the two reached home and entered the salon on the
ground-floor,<br>
 they found a large fire lighted, and Madame Saillard,
Elisabeth,<br>
 Monsieur Gaudron and the curate of Saint-Paul's sitting by it.
The<br>
 curate turned at once to Monsieur Baudoyer, to whom Elisabeth
made a<br>
 sign which he failed to understand.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the curate, "I have lost no time in coming in
person<br>
 to thank you for the magnificent gift with which you have
adorned my<br>
 poor church. I dared not run in debt to buy that beautiful
monstrance,<br>
 worthy of a cathedral. You, who are one of our most pious and
faithful<br>
 parishioners, must have keenly felt the bareness of the high
altar. I<br>
 am on my way to see Monseigneur the coadjutor, and he will, I am
sure,<br>
 send you his own thanks later."</p>

<p><br>
 "I have done nothing as yet--" began Baudoyer.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le cure," interposed his wife, cutting him short. "I
see I<br>
 am forced to betray the whole secret. Monsieur Baudoyer hopes
to<br>
 complete the gift by sending you a dais for the coming
Fete-Dieu. But<br>
 the purchase must depend on the state of our finances, and
our<br>
 finances depend on my husband's promotion."</p>

<p>"God will reward those who honor him," said Monsieur
Gaudron,<br>
 preparing, with the curate, to take leave.</p>

<p>"But will you not," said Saillard to the two ecclesiastics,
"do us the<br>
 honor to take pot luck with us?"</p>

<p>"You can stay, my dear vicar," said the curate to Gaudron;
"you know I<br>
 am engaged to dine with the curate of Saint-Roch, who, by the
bye, is<br>
 to bury Monsieur de la Billardiere to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Monsieur le cure de Saint-Roch might say a word for us,"
began<br>
 Baudoyer. His wife pulled the skirt of his coat violently.</p>

<p>"Do hold your tongue, Baudoyer," she said, leading him aside
and<br>
 whispering in his ear. "You have given a monstrance to the
church,<br>
 that cost five thousand francs. I'll explain it all later."</p>

<p>The miserly Baudoyer make a sulky grimace, and continued
gloomy and<br>
 cross for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>"What did you busy yourself about Falleix's passport for? Why
do you<br>
 meddle in other people's affairs?" he presently asked her.</p>

<p>"I must say, I think Falleix's affairs are as much ours as
his,"<br>
 returned Elisabeth, dryly, glancing at her husband to make him
notice<br>
 Monsieur Gaudron, before whom he ought to be silent.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," said old Saillard, thinking of his
co-<br>
 partnership.</p>

<p>"I hope you reached the newspaper office in time?" remarked
Elisabeth<br>
 to Monsieur Gaudron, as she helped him to soup.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear lady," answered the vicar; "when the editor read
the<br>
 little article I gave him, written by the secretary of the
Grand<br>
 Almoner, he made no difficulty. He took pains to insert it in
a<br>
 conspicuous place. I should never have thought of that; but this
young<br>
 journalist has a wide-awake mind. The defenders of religion can
enter<br>
 the lists against impiety without disadvantage at the present
moment,<br>
 for there is a great deal of talent in the royalist press. I
have<br>
 every reason to believe that success will crown your hopes. But
you<br>
 must remember, my dear Baudoyer, to promote Monsieur Colleville;
he is<br>
 an object of great interest to his Eminence; in fact, I am
desired to<br>
 mention him to you."</p>

<p>"If I am head of the division, I will make him head of one of
my<br>
 bureaus, if you want me to," said Baudoyer.</p>

<p>The matter thus referred to was explained after dinner, when
the<br>
 ministerial organ (bought and sent up by the porter) proved to
contain<br>
 among its Paris news the following articles, called items:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Monsieur le Baron de la Billardiere died this morning, after
a<br>
 long and painful illness. The king loses a devoted servant,
the<br>
 Church a most pious son. Monsieur de la Billardiere's end
has<br>
 fitly crowned a noble life, consecrated in dark and
troublesome<br>
 times to perilous missions, and of late years to arduous
civic<br>
 duties. Monsieur de la Billardiere was provost of a
department,<br>
 where his force of character triumphed over all the obstacles
that<br>
 rebellion arrayed against him. He subsequently accepted the<br>
 difficult post of director of a division (in which his great<br>
 acquirements were not less useful than the truly French
affability<br>
 of his manners) for the express purpose of conciliating the<br>
 serious interests that arise under its administration. No
rewards<br>
 have ever been more truly deserved than those by which the
King,<br>
 Louis XVIII., and his present Majesty took pleasure in crowning
a<br>
 loyalty which never faltered under the usurper. This old
family<br>
 still survives in the person of a single heir to the excellent
man<br>
 whose death now afflicts so many warm friends. His Majesty
has<br>
 already graciously made known that Monsieur Benjamin de la<br>
 Billardiere will be included among the gentlemen-in-ordinary
of<br>
 the Bedchamber.</p>

<p>"The numerous friends who have not already received their<br>
 notification of this sad event are hereby informed that the<br>
 funeral will take place to-morrow at four o'clock, in the
church<br>
 of Saint-Roch. The memorial address will be delivered by
Monsieur<br>
 l'Abbe Fontanon."</p>

<p><br>
 ----</p>

<p>"Monsieur Isidore-Charles-Thomas Baudoyer, representing one of
the<br>
 oldest bourgeois families of Paris, and head of a bureau in
the<br>
 late Monsieur de la Billardiere's division, has lately
recalled<br>
 the old traditions of piety and devotion which formerly<br>
 distinguished these great families, so jealous for the honor
and<br>
 glory of religion, and so faithful in preserving its
monuments.<br>
 The church of Saint-Paul has long needed a monstrance in
keeping<br>
 with the magnificence of that basilica, itself due to the
Company<br>
 of Jesus. Neither the vestry nor the curate were rich enough
to<br>
 decorate the altar. Monsieur Baudoyer has bestowed upon the
parish<br>
 a monstrance that many persons have seen and admired at
Monsieur<br>
 Gohier's, the king's jeweller. Thanks to the piety of this<br>
 gentleman, who did not shrink from the immensity of the price,
the<br>
 church of Saint-Paul possesses to-day a masterpiece of the<br>
 jeweller's art designed by Monsieur de Sommervieux. It gives
us<br>
 pleasure to make known this fact, which proves how powerless
the<br>
 declamations of liberals have been on the mind of the
Parisian<br>
 bourgeoisie. The upper ranks of that body have at all times
been<br>
 royalist and they prove it when occasion offers."</p>

<p>"The price was five thousand francs," said the Abbe Gaudron;
"but as<br>
 the payment was in cash, the court jeweller reduced the
amount."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Representing one of the oldest bourgeois families in Paris!"
Saillard<br>
 was saying to himself; "there it is printed,--in the official
paper,<br>
 too!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br>
 "Dear Monsieur Gaudron," said Madame Baudoyer, "please help my
father<br>
 to compose a little speech that he could slip into the
countess's ear<br>
 when he takes her the monthly stipend,--a single sentence that
would<br>
 cover all! I must leave you. I am obliged to go out with my
uncle<br>
 Mitral. Would you believe it? I was unable to find my uncle
Bidault at<br>
 home this afternoon. Oh, what a dog-kennel he lives in! But
Monsieur<br>
 Mitral, who knows his ways, says he does all his business
between<br>
 eight o'clock in the morning and midday, and that after that
hour he<br>
 can be found only at a certain cafe called the Cafe
Themis,--a<br>
 singular name."</p>

<p>"Is justice done there?" said the abbe, laughing.</p>

<p>"Do you ask why he goes to a cafe at the corner of the rue
Dauphine<br>
 and the quai des Augustins? They say he plays dominoes there
every<br>
 night with his friend Monsieur Gobseck. I don't wish to go to
such a<br>
 place alone; my uncle Mitral will take me there and bring me
back."</p>

<p>At this instant Mitral showed his yellow face, surmounted by a
wig<br>
 which looked as though it might be made of hay, and made a sign
to his<br>
 niece to come at once, and not keep a carriage waiting at two
francs<br>
 an hour. Madame Baudoyer rose and went away without giving
any<br>
 explanation to her husband or father.</p>

<p>"Heaven has given you in that woman," said Monsieur Gaudron
to<br>
 Baudoyer when Elisabeth had disappeared, "a perfect treasure
of<br>
 prudence and virtue, a model of wisdom, a Christian who gives
sure<br>
 signs of possessing the Divine spirit. Religion alone is able to
form<br>
 such perfect characters. To-morrow I shall say a mass for the
success<br>
 of your good cause. It is all-important, for the sake of the
monarchy<br>
 and of religion itself that you should receive this
appointment.<br>
 Monsieur Rabourdin is a liberal; he subscribes to the 'Journal
des<br>
 Debats,' a dangerous newspaper, which made war on Monsieur le
Comte de<br>
 Villele to please the wounded vanity of Monsieur de
Chateaubriand. His<br>
 Eminence will read the newspaper to-night, if only to see what
is said<br>
 of his poor friend Monsieur de la Billardiere; and Monseigneur
the<br>
 coadjutor will speak of you to the King. When I think of what
you have<br>
 now done for his dear church, I feel sure he will not forget you
in<br>
 his prayers; more than that, he is dining at this moment with
the<br>
 coadjutor at the house of the curate of Saint-Roch."</p>

<p>These words made Saillard and Baudoyer begin to perceive
that<br>
 Elisabeth had not been idle ever since Godard had informed her
of<br>
 Monsieur de la Billardiere's decease.</p>

<p>"Isn't she clever, that Elisabeth of mine?" cried
Saillard,<br>
 comprehending more clearly than Monsieur l'abbe the rapid
undermining,<br>
 like the path of a mole, which his daughter had undertaken.</p>

<p>"She sent Godard to Rabourdin's door to find out what
newspaper he<br>
 takes," said Gaudron; "and I mentioned the name to the secretary
of<br>
 his Eminence,--for we live at a crisis when the Church and
Throne must<br>
 keep themselves informed as to who are their friends and who
their<br>
 enemies."</p>

<p>"For the last five days I have been trying to find the right
thing to<br>
 say to his Excellency's wife," said Saillard.</p>

<p>"All Paris will read that," cried Baudoyer, whose eyes were
still<br>
 riveted on the paper.</p>

<p>"Your eulogy costs us four thousand eight hundred francs,
son-in-law!"<br>
 exclaimed Madame Saillard.</p>

<p>"You have adorned the house of God," said the Abbe
Gaudron.</p>

<p>"We might have got salvation without doing that," she
returned. "But<br>
 if Baudoyer gets the place, which is worth eight thousand more,
the<br>
 sacrifice is not so great. If he doesn't get it! hey, papa,"
she<br>
 added, looking at her husband, "how we shall have bled!--"</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," said Saillard, enthusiastically, "we can
always<br>
 make it up through Falleix, who is going to extend his business
and<br>
 use his brother, whom he has made a stockbroker on purpose.
Elisabeth<br>
 might have told us, I think, why Falleix went off in such a
hurry. But<br>
 let's invent my little speech. This is what I thought of:
'Madame, if<br>
 you would say a word to his Excellency--'"</p>

<p>"'If you would deign,'" said Gaudron; "add the word 'deign,'
it is<br>
 more respectful. But you ought to know, first of all, whether
Madame<br>
 la Dauphine will grant you her protection, and then you could
suggest<br>
 to Madame la comtesse the idea of co-operating with the wishes
of her<br>
 Royal Highness."</p>

<p>"You ought to designate the vacant post," said Baudoyer.</p>

<p>"'Madame la comtesse,'" began Saillard, rising, and bowing to
his<br>
 wife, with an agreeable smile.</p>

<p>"Goodness! Saillard; how ridiculous you look. Take care, my
man,<br>
 you'll make the woman laugh."</p>

<p>"'Madame la comtesse,'" resumed Saillard. "Is that better,
wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my duck."</p>

<p>"'The place of the worthy Monsieur de la Billardiere is
vacant; my<br>
 son-in-law, Monsieur Baudoyer--'"</p>

<p>"'Man of talent and extreme piety,'" prompted Gaudron.</p>

<p>"Write it down, Baudoyer," cried old Saillard, "write that
sentence<br>
 down."</p>

<p>Baudoyer proceeded to take a pen and wrote, without a blush,
his own<br>
 praises, precisely as Nathan or Canalis might have reviewed one
of<br>
 their own books.</p>

<p>"'Madame la comtesse'-- Don't you see, mother?" said Saillard
to his<br>
 wife; "I am supposing you to be the minister's wife."</p>

<p>"Do you take me for a fool?" she answered sharply. "I know
that."</p>

<p>"'The place of the late worthy de la Billardiere is vacant; my
son-in-<br>
 law, Monsieur Baudoyer, a man of consummate talent and
extreme<br>
 piety--'" After looking at Monsieur Gaudron, who was reflecting,
he<br>
 added, "'will be very glad if he gets it.' That's not bad; it's
brief<br>
 and it says the whole thing."</p>

<p>"But do wait, Saillard; don't you see that Monsieur l'abbe is
turning<br>
 it over in his mind?" said Madame Saillard; "don't disturb
him."</p>

<p>"'Will be very thankful if you would deign to interest
yourself in his<br>
 behalf,'" resumed Gaudron. "'And in saying a word to his
Excellency<br>
 you will particularly please Madame la Dauphine, by whom he has
the<br>
 honor and the happiness to be protected.'"</p>

<p>"Ah! Monsieur Gaudron, that sentence is worth more than
the<br>
 monstrance; I don't regret the four thousand eight hundred--
Besides,<br>
 Baudoyer, my lad, you'll pay them, won't you? Have you written
it all<br>
 down?"</p>

<p>"I shall make you repeat it, father, morning and evening,"
said Madame<br>
 Saillard. "Yes, that's a good speech. How lucky you are,
Monsieur<br>
 Gaudron, to know so much. That's what it is to be brought up in
a<br>
 seminary; they learn there how to speak to God and his
saints."</p>

<p>"He is as good as he is learned," said Baudoyer, pressing the
priest's<br>
 hand. "Did you write that article?" he added, pointing to
the<br>
 newspaper.</p>

<p>"No, it was written by the secretary of his Eminence, a young
abbe who<br>
 is under obligations to me, and who takes an interest in
Monsieur<br>
 Colleville; he was educated at my expense."</p>

<p>"A good deed is always rewarded," said Baudoyer.</p>

<p>While these four personages were sitting down to their game of
boston,<br>
 Elisabeth and her uncle Mitral reached the cafe Themis, with
much<br>
 discourse as they drove along about a matter which Elisabeth's
keen<br>
 perceptions told her was the most powerful lever that could be
used to<br>
 force the minister's hand in the affair of her husband's
appointment.<br>
 Uncle Mitral, a former sheriff's officer, crafty, clever at
sharp<br>
 practice, and full of expedients and judicial precautions,
believed<br>
 the honor of his family to be involved in the appointment of
his<br>
 nephew. His avarice had long led him to estimate the contents of
old<br>
 Gigonnet's strong-box, for he knew very well they would go in
the end<br>
 to benefit his nephew Baudoyer; and it was therefore important
that<br>
 the latter should obtain a position which would be in keeping
with the<br>
 combined fortunes of the Saillards and the old Gigonnet, which
would<br>
 finally devolve on the Baudoyer's little daughter; and what an
heiress<br>
 she would be with an income of a hundred thousand francs! to
what<br>
 social position might she not aspire with that fortune? He
adopted all<br>
 the ideas of his niece Elisabeth and thoroughly understood them.
He<br>
 had helped in sending off Falleix expeditiously, explaining to
him the<br>
 advantage of taking post horses. After which, while eating his
dinner,<br>
 he reflected that it be as well to give a twist of his own to
the<br>
 clever plan invented by Elisabeth.</p>

<p>When they reached the Cafe Themis he told his niece that he
alone<br>
 could manage Gigonnet in the matter they both had in view, and
he made<br>
 her wait in the hackney-coach and bide her time to come forward
at the<br>
 right moment. Elisabeth saw through the window-panes the two
faces of<br>
 Gobseck and Gigonnet (her uncle Bidault), which stood out in
relief<br>
 against the yellow wood-work of the old cafe, like two cameo
heads,<br>
 cold and impassible, in the rigid attitude that their gravity
gave<br>
 them. The two Parisian misers were surrounded by a number of
other old<br>
 faces, on which "thirty per cent discount" was written in
circular<br>
 wrinkles that started from the nose and turned round the
glacial<br>
 cheek-bones. These remarkable physiognomies brightened up on
seeing<br>
 Mitral, and their eyes gleamed with tigerish curiosity.</p>

<p>"Hey, hey! it is papa Mitral!" cried one of them, named
Chaboisseau, a<br>
 little old man who discounted for a publisher.</p>

<p>"Bless me, so it is!" said another, a broker named Metivier,
"ha,<br>
 that's an old monkey well up in his tricks."</p>

<p>"And you," retorted Mitral, "you are an old crow who knows all
about<br>
 carcasses."</p>

<p>"True," said the stern Gobseck.</p>

<p>"What are you here for? Have you come to seize friend
Metivier?" asked<br>
 Gigonnet, pointing to the broker, who had the bluff face of a
porter.</p>

<p>"Your great-niece Elisabeth is out there, papa Gigonnet,"
whispered<br>
 Mitral.</p>

<p>"What! some misfortune?" said Bidault. The old man drew his
eyebrows<br>
 together and assumed a tender look like that of an executioner
when<br>
 about to go to work officially. In spite of his Roman virtue he
must<br>
 have been touched, for his red nose lost somewhat of its
color.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose it is misfortune, won't you help Saillard's
daughter?--<br>
 a girl who has knitted your stockings for the last thirty
years!"<br>
 cried Mitral.</p>

<p>"If there's good security I don't say I won't," replied
Gigonnet.<br>
 "Falleix is in with them. Falleix has just set up his brother as
a<br>
 broker, and he is doing as much business as the Brezacs; and
what<br>
 with? his mind, perhaps! Saillard is no simpleton."</p>

<p>"He knows the value of money," put in Chaboisseau.</p>

<p>That remark, uttered among those old men, would have made an
artist<br>
 and thinker shudder as they all nodded their heads.</p>

<p>"But it is none of my business," resumed Bidault-Gigonnet.
"I'm not<br>
 bound to care for my neighbors' misfortunes. My principle is
never to<br>
 be off my guard with friends or relatives; you can't perish
except<br>
 through weakness. Apply to Gobseck; he is softer."</p>

<p>The usurers all applauded these doctrines with a shake of
their<br>
 metallic heads. An onlooker would have fancied he heard the
creaking<br>
 of ill-oiled machinery.</p>

<p>"Come, Gigonnet, show a little feeling," said Chaboisseau,
"they've<br>
 knit your stockings for thirty years."</p>

<p>"That counts for something," remarked Gobseck.</p>

<p>"Are you all alone? Is it safe to speak?" said Mitral,
looking<br>
 carefully about him. "I come about a good piece of
business."</p>

<p>"If it is good, why do you come to us?" said Gigonnet,
sharply,<br>
 interrupting Mitral.</p>

<p>"A fellow who was a gentleman of the Bedchamber," went on
Mitral, "a<br>
 former 'chouan,'--what's his name?--La Billardiere is dead."</p>

<p>"True," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>"And our nephew is giving monstrances to the church,"
snarled<br>
 Gigonnet.</p>

<p>"He is not such a fool as to give them, he sells them, old
man," said<br>
 Mitral, proudly. "He wants La Billardiere's place, and in order
to get<br>
 it, we must seize--"</p>

<p>"Seize! You'll never be anything but a sheriff's officer," put
in<br>
 Metivier, striking Mitral amicably on the shoulder; "I like
that, I<br>
 do!"</p>

<p>"Seize Monsieur Clement des Lupeaulx in our clutches,"
continued<br>
 Mitral; "Elisabeth has discovered how to do it, and he is--"</p>

<p>"Elisabeth"; cried Gigonnet, interrupting again; "dear
little<br>
 creature! she takes after her grandfather, my poor brother! he
never<br>
 had his equal! Ah, you should have seen him buying up old
furniture;<br>
 what tact! what shrewdness! What does Elisabeth want?"</p>

<p>"Hey! hey!" cried Mitral, "you've got back your bowels of
compassion,<br>
 papa Gigonnet! That phenomenon has a cause."</p>

<p>"Always a child," said Gobseck to Gigonnet, "you are too quick
on the<br>
 trigger."</p>

<p>"Come, Gobseck and Gigonnet, listen to me; you want to keep
well with<br>
 des Lupeaulx, don't you? You've not forgotten how you plucked
him in<br>
 that affair about the king's debts, and you are afraid he'll ask
you<br>
 to return some of his feathers," said Mitral.</p>

<p>"Shall we tell him the whole thing?" asked Gobseck, whispering
to<br>
 Gigonnet.</p>

<p>"Mitral is one of us; he wouldn't play a shabby trick on his
former<br>
 customers," replied Gigonnet. "You see, Mitral," he went on,
speaking<br>
 to the ex-sheriff in a low voice, "we three have just bought up
all<br>
 those debts, the payment of which depends on the decision of
the<br>
 liquidation committee."</p>

<p>"How much will you lose?" asked Mitral.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>"Nobody knows we are in it," added Gigonnet; "Samanon screens
us."</p>

<p>"Come, listen to me, Gigonnet; it is cold, and your niece is
waiting<br>
 outside. You'll understand what I want in two words. You must at
once,<br>
 between you, send two hundred and fifty thousand francs
(without<br>
 interest) into the country after Falleix, who has gone
post-haste,<br>
 with a courier in advance of him."</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" said Gobseck.</p>

<p>"What for?" cried Gigonnet, "and where to?"</p>

<p>"To des Lupeaulx's magnificent country-seat," replied Mitral.
"Falleix<br>
 knows the country, for he was born there; and he is going to buy
up<br>
 land all round the secretary's miserable hovel, with the two
hundred<br>
 and fifty thousand francs I speak of,--good land, well worth
the<br>
 price. There are only nine days before us for drawing up and
recording<br>
 the notarial deeds (bear that in mind). With the addition of
this<br>
 land, des Lupeaulx's present miserable property would pay taxes
to the<br>
 amount of one thousand francs, the sum necessary to make a
man<br>
 eligible to the Chamber. Ergo, with it des Lupeaulx goes into
the<br>
 electoral college, becomes eligible, count, and whatever he
pleases.<br>
 You know the deputy who has slipped out and left a vacancy,
don't<br>
 you?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br>
 The two misers nodded.</p>

<p>"Des Lupeaulx would cut off a leg to get elected in his
place,"<br>
 continued Mitral; "but he must have the title-deeds of the
property in<br>
 his own name, and then mortgage them back to us for the amount
of the<br>
 purchase-money. Ah! now you begin to see what I am after! First
of<br>
 all, we must make sure of Baudoyer's appointment, and des
Lupeaulx<br>
 will get it for us on these terms; after that is settled we will
hand<br>
 him back to you. Falleix is now canvassing the electoral vote.
Don't<br>
 you perceive that you have Lupeaulx completely in your power
until<br>
 after the election?--for Falleix's friends are a large majority.
Now<br>
 do you see what I mean, papa Gigonnet?"</p>

<p>"It's a clever game," said Metivier.</p>

<p>"We'll do it," said Gigonnet; "you agree, don't you, Gobseck?
Falleix<br>
 can give us security and put mortgages on the property in my
name;<br>
 we'll go and see des Lupeaulx when all is ready."</p>

<p>"We're robbed," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Mitral, "I'd like to know the robber!"</p>

<p>"Nobody can rob us but ourselves," answered Gigonnet. "I told
you we<br>
 were doing a good thing in buying up all des Lupeaulx's paper
from his<br>
 creditors at sixty per cent discount."</p>

<p>"Take this mortgage on his estate and you'll hold him tighter
still<br>
 through the interest," answered Mitral.</p>

<p>"Possibly," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>After exchanging a shrewd look with Gobseck, Gigonnet went to
the door<br>
 of the cafe.</p>

<p>"Elisabeth! follow it up, my dear," he said to his niece. "We
hold<br>
 your man securely; but don't neglect accessories. You have begun
well,<br>
 clever woman! go on as you began and you'll have your uncle's
esteem,"<br>
 and he grasped her hand, gayly.</p>

<p>"But," said Mitral, "Metivier and Chaboisseau heard it all,
and they<br>
 may play us a trick and tell the matter to some opposition
journal<br>
 which would catch the ball on its way and counteract the effect
of the<br>
 ministerial article. You must go alone, my dear; I dare not let
those<br>
 two cormorants out of my sight." So saying he re-entered the
cafe.</p>

<p>The next day the numerous subscribers to a certain liberal
journal<br>
 read, among the Paris items, the following article, inserted<br>
 authoritatively by Chaboisseau and Metivier, share-holders in
the said<br>
 journal, brokers for publishers, printers, and paper-makers,
whose<br>
 behests no editor dared refuse:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Yesterday a ministerial journal plainly indicated as the
probable<br>
 successor of Monsieur le Baron de la Billardiere, Monsieur<br>
 Baudoyer, one of the worthiest citizens of a populous
quarter,<br>
 where his benevolence is scarcely less known than the piety
on<br>
 which the ministerial organ laid so much stress. Why was
that<br>
 sheet silent as to his talents? Did it reflect that in boasting
of<br>
 the bourgeoise nobility of Monsieur Baudoyer--which, certainly,
is<br>
 a nobility as good as any other--it was pointing out a reason
for<br>
 the exclusion of the candidate? A gratuitous piece of perfidy!
an<br>
 attempt to kill with a caress! To appoint Monsieur Baudoyer is
to<br>
 do honor to the virtues, the talents of the middle classes,
of<br>
 whom we shall ever be the supporters, though their cause seems
at<br>
 times a lost one. This appointment, we repeat, will be an act
of<br>
 justice and good policy; consequently we may be sure it will
not<br>
 be made."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the morrow, Friday, the usual day for the dinner given by
Madame<br>
 Rabourdin, whom des Lupeaulx had left at midnight, radiant in
beauty,<br>
 on the staircase of the Bouffons, arm in arm with Madame de
Camps<br>
 (Madame Firmiani had lately married), the old roue awoke with
his<br>
 thoughts of vengeance calmed, or rather refreshed, and his mind
full<br>
 of a last glance exchanged with Celestine.</p>

<p><br>
 "I'll make sure of Rabourdin's support by forgiving him
now,--I'll get<br>
 even with him later. If he hasn't this place for the time being
I<br>
 should have to give up a woman who is capable of becoming a
most<br>
 precious instrument in the pursuit of high political fortune.
She<br>
 understands everything; shrinks from nothing, from no idea
whatever!--<br>
 and besides, I can't know before his Excellency what new scheme
of<br>
 administration Rabourdin has invented. No, my dear des Lupeaulx,
the<br>
 thing in hand is to win all now for your Celestine. You may make
as<br>
 many faces as you please, Madame la comtesse, but you will
invite<br>
 Madame Rabourdin to your next select party."</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx was one of those men who to satisfy a passion are
quite<br>
 able to put away revenge in some dark corner of their minds.
His<br>
 course was taken; he was resolved to get Rabourdin
appointed.</p>

<p>"I will prove to you, my dear fellow, that I deserve a good
place in<br>
 your galley," thought he as he seated himself in his study and
began<br>
 to unfold a newspaper.</p>

<p>He knew so well what the ministerial organ would contain that
he<br>
 rarely took the trouble to read it, but on this occasion he did
open<br>
 it to look at the article on La Billardiere, recollecting
with<br>
 amusement the dilemma in which du Bruel had put him by bringing
him<br>
 the night before Bixiou's amendments to the obituary. He was
laughing<br>
 to himself as he reread the biography of the late Comte da
Fontaine,<br>
 dead a few months earlier, which he had hastily substituted for
that<br>
 of La Billardiere, when his eyes were dazzled by the name of
Baudoyer.<br>
 He read with fury the article which pledged the minister, and
then he<br>
 rang violently for Dutocq, to send him at once to the editor.
But what<br>
 was his astonishment on reading the reply of the opposition
paper! The<br>
 situation was evidently serious. He knew the game, and he saw
that the<br>
 man who was shuffling his cards for him was a Greek of the
first<br>
 order. To dictate in this way through two opposing newspapers in
one<br>
 evening, and to begin the fight by forestalling the intentions
of the<br>
 minister was a daring game! He recognized the pen of a liberal
editor,<br>
 and resolved to question him that night at the opera. Dutocq
appeared.</p>

<p>"Read that," said des Lupeaulx, handing him over the two
journals, and<br>
 continuing to run his eye over others to see if Baudoyer had
pulled<br>
 any further wires. "Go to the office and ask who has dared to
thus<br>
 compromise the minister."</p>

<p>"It was not Monsieur Baudoyer himself," answered Dutocq, "for
he never<br>
 left the ministry yesterday. I need not go and inquire; for when
I<br>
 took your article to the newspaper office I met a young abbe
who<br>
 brought in a letter from the Grand Almoner, before which you
yourself<br>
 would have had to bow."</p>

<p>"Dutocq, you have a grudge against Monsieur Rabourdin, and it
isn't<br>
 right; for he has twice saved you from being turned out.
However, we<br>
 are not masters of our own feelings; we sometimes hate our<br>
 benefactors. Only, remember this; if you show the slightest
treachery<br>
 to Rabourdin, without my permission, it will be your ruin. As to
that<br>
 newspaper, let the Grand Almoner subscribe as largely as we do,
if he<br>
 wants its services. Here we are at the end of the year; the
matter of<br>
 subscriptions will come up for discussion, and I shall have
something<br>
 to say on that head. As to La Billardiere's place, there is only
one<br>
 way to settle the matter; and that is to appoint Rabourdin this
very<br>
 day."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Dutocq, returning to the clerks' office
and<br>
 addressing his colleagues. "I don't know if Bixiou has the art
of<br>
 looking into futurity, but if you have not read the
ministerial<br>
 journal I advise you to study the article about Baudoyer; then,
as<br>
 Monsieur Fleury takes the opposition sheet, you can see the
reply.<br>
 Monsieur Rabourdin certainly has talent, but a man who in these
days<br>
 gives a six-thousand-franc monstrance to the Church has a
devilish<br>
 deal more talent than he."</p>

<p>Bixiou [entering]. "What say you, gentlemen, to the First
Epistle to<br>
 the Corinthians in our pious ministerial journal, and the
reply<br>
 Epistle to the Ministers in the opposition sheet? How does
Monsieur<br>
 Rabourdin feel now, du Bruel?"</p>

<p>Du Bruel [rushing in]. "I don't know." [He drags Bixiou back
into his<br>
 cabinet, and says in a low voice] "My good fellow, your way of
helping<br>
 people is like that of the hangman who jumps upon a victim's
shoulders<br>
 to break his neck. You got me into a scrape with des Lupeaulx,
which<br>
 my folly in ever trusting you richly deserved. A fine thing
indeed,<br>
 that article on La Billardiere. I sha'n't forget the trick! Why,
the<br>
 very first sentence was as good as telling the King he was<br>
 superannuated and it was time for him to die. And as to that
Quiberon<br>
 bit, it said plainly that the King was a-- What a fool I
was!"</p>

<p>Bixiou [laughing]. "Bless my heart! are you getting angry?
Can't a<br>
 fellow joke any more?"</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "Joke! joke indeed. When you want to be made
head-clerk<br>
 somebody shall joke with you, my dear fellow."</p>

<p>Bixiou [in a bullying tone]. "Angry, are we?"</p>

<p>Du Bruel. "Yes!"</p>

<p>Bixiou [dryly]. "So much the worse for you."</p>

<p>Du Bruel [uneasy]. "You wouldn't pardon such a thing yourself,
I<br>
 know."</p>

<p>Bixiou [in a wheedling tone]. "To a friend? indeed I would."
[They<br>
 hear Fleury's voice.] "There's Fleury cursing Baudoyer. Hey, how
well<br>
 the thing has been managed! Baudoyer will get the
appointment."<br>
 [Confidentially] "After all, so much the better. Du Bruel, just
keep<br>
 your eye on the consequences. Rabourdin would be a
mean-spirited<br>
 creature to stay under Baudoyer; he will send in his
registration, and<br>
 that will give us two places. You can be head of the bureau and
take<br>
 me for under-head-clerk. We will make vaudevilles together, and
I'll<br>
 fag at your work in the office."</p>

<p>Du Bruel [smiling]. "Dear me, I never thought of that. Poor
Rabourdin!<br>
 I shall be sorry for him, though."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "That shows how much you love him!" [Changing his
tone] "Ah,<br>
 well, I don't pity him any longer. He's rich; his wife gives
parties<br>
 and doesn't ask me,--me, who go everywhere! Well, good-bye, my
dear<br>
 fellow, good-bye, and don't owe me a grudge!" [He goes out
through the<br>
 clerks' office.] "Adieu, gentlemen; didn't I tell you yesterday
that a<br>
 man who has nothing but virtues and talents will always be poor,
even<br>
 though he has a pretty wife?"</p>

<p>Henry. "You are so rich, you!"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Not bad, my Cincinnatus! But you'll give me that
dinner at<br>
 the Rocher de Cancale."</p>

<p>Poiret. "It is absolutely impossible for me to understand
Monsieur<br>
 Bixiou."</p>

<p>Phellion [with an elegaic air]. "Monsieur Rabourdin so seldom
reads<br>
 the newspapers that it might perhaps be serviceable to
deprive<br>
 ourselves momentarily by taking them in to him." [Fleury hands
over<br>
 his paper, Vimeux the office sheet, and Phellion departs with
them.]</p>

<p>At that moment des Lupeaulx, coming leisurely downstairs to
breakfast<br>
 with the minister, was asking himself whether, before playing a
trump<br>
 card for the husband, it might not be prudent to probe the
wife's<br>
 heart and make sure of a reward for his devotion. He was feeling
about<br>
 for the small amount of heart that he possessed, when, at a turn
of<br>
 the staircase, he encountered his lawyer, who said to him,
smiling,<br>
 "Just a word, Monseigneur," in the tone of familiarity assumed
by men<br>
 who know they are indispensable.</p>

<p>"What is it, my dear Desroches?" exclaimed the politician.
"Has<br>
 anything happened?"</p>

<p>"I have come to tell you that all your notes and debts have
been<br>
 brought up by Gobseck and Gigonnet, under the name of a
certain<br>
 Samanon."</p>

<p>"Men whom I helped to make their millions!"</p>

<p>"Listen," whispered the lawyer. "Gigonnet (really named
Bidault) is<br>
 the uncle of Saillard, your cashier; and Saillard is
father-in-law to<br>
 a certain Baudoyer, who thinks he has a right to the vacant
place in<br>
 your ministry. Don't you think I have done right to come and
tell<br>
 you?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said des Lupeaulx, nodding to the lawyer with a
shrewd<br>
 look.</p>

<p>"One stroke of your pen will buy them off," said Desroches,
leaving<br>
 him.</p>

<p>"What an immense sacrifice!" muttered des Lupeaulx. "It would
be<br>
 impossible to explain it to a woman," thought he. "Is Celestine
worth<br>
 more than the clearing off of my debts?--that is the question.
I'll go<br>
 and see her this morning."</p>

<p>So the beautiful Madame Rabourdin was to be, within an hour,
the<br>
 arbiter of her husband's fate, and no power on earth could warn
her of<br>
 the importance of her replies, or give her the least hint to
guard her<br>
 conduct and compose her voice. Moreover, in addition to her<br>
 mischances, she believed herself certain of success, never
dreaming<br>
 that Rabourdin was undermined in all directions by the secret
sapping<br>
 of the mollusks.</p>

<p>"Well, Monseigneur," said des Lupeaulx, entering the little
salon<br>
 where they breakfasted, "have you seen the articles on
Baudoyer?"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, my dear friend," replied the minister, "don't
talk of<br>
 those appointments just now; let me have an hour's peace! They
cracked<br>
 my ears last night with that monstrance. The only way to
save<br>
 Rabourdin is to bring his appointment before the Council, unless
I<br>
 submit to having my hand forced. It is enough to disgust a man
with<br>
 the public service. I must purchase the right to keep that
excellent<br>
 Rabourdin by promoting a certain Colleville!"</p>

<p>"Why not make over the management of this pretty little comedy
to me,<br>
 and rid yourself of the worry of it? I'll amuse you every
morning with<br>
 an account of the game of chess I should play with the Grand
Almoner,"<br>
 said des Lupeaulx.</p>

<p>"Very good," said the minister, "settle it with the head
examiner. But<br>
 you know perfectly well that nothing is more likely to strike
the<br>
 king's mind than just those reasons the opposition journal has
chosen<br>
 to put forth. Good heavens! fancy managing a ministry with such
men as<br>
 Baudoyer under me!"</p>

<p>"An imbecile bigot," said des Lupeaulx, "and as utterly
incapable<br>
 as--"</p>

<p>"--as La Billardiere," added the minister.</p>

<p>"But La Billardiere had the manners of a
gentleman-in-ordinary,"<br>
 replied des Lupeaulx. "Madame," he continued, addressing the
countess,<br>
 "it is now an absolute necessity to invite Madame Rabourdin to
your<br>
 next private party. I must assure you she is the intimate friend
of<br>
 Madame de Camps; they were at the Opera together last night. I
first<br>
 met her at the hotel Firmiani. Besides, you will see that she is
not<br>
 of a kind to compromise a salon."</p>

<p>"Invite Madame Rabourdin, my dear," said the minister, "and
pray let<br>
 us talk of something else."</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4>SCENES FROM DOMESTIC LIFE</h4>

<p>Parisian households are literally eaten up with the desire to
be in<br>
 keeping with the luxury that surrounds them on all sides, and
few<br>
 there are who have the wisdom to let their external situation
conform<br>
 to their internal revenue. But this vice may perhaps denote a
truly<br>
 French patriotism, which seeks to maintain the supremacy of the
nation<br>
 in the matter of dress. France reigns through clothes over the
whole<br>
 of Europe; and every one must feel the importance of retaining
a<br>
 commercial sceptre that makes fashion in France what the navy is
to<br>
 England. This patriotic ardor which leads a nation to
sacrifice<br>
 everything to appearances--to the "paroistre," as d'Aubigne said
in<br>
 the days of Henri IV.--is the cause of those vast secret labors
which<br>
 employ the whole of a Parisian woman's morning, when she wishes,
as<br>
 Madame Rabourdin wished, to keep up on twelve thousand francs a
year<br>
 the style that many a family with thirty thousand does not
indulge in.<br>
 Consequently, every Friday,--the day of her dinner
parties,--Madame<br>
 Rabourdin helped the chambermaid to do the rooms; for the cook
went<br>
 early to market, and the man-servant was cleaning the silver,
folding<br>
 the napkins, and polishing the glasses. The ill-advised
individual who<br>
 might happen, through an oversight of the porter, to enter
Madame<br>
 Rabourdin's establishment about eleven o'clock in the morning
would<br>
 have found her in the midst of a disorder the reverse of
picturesque,<br>
 wrapped in a dressing-gown, her hair ill-dressed, and her feet
in old<br>
 slippers, attending to the lamps, arranging the flowers, or
cooking in<br>
 haste an extremely unpoetic breakfast. The visitor to whom
the<br>
 mysteries of Parisian life were unknown would certainly have
learned<br>
 for the rest of his life not to set foot in these greenrooms at
the<br>
 wrong moment; a woman caught in her matin mysteries would ever
after<br>
 point him out as a man capable of the blackest crimes; or she
would<br>
 talk of his stupidity and indiscretion in a manner to ruin him.
The<br>
 true Parisian woman, indulgent to all curiosity that she can put
to<br>
 profit, is implacable to that which makes her lose her prestige.
Such<br>
 a domiciliary invasion may be called, not only (as they say in
police<br>
 reports) an attack on privacy, but a burglary, a robbery of all
that<br>
 is most precious, namely, CREDIT. A woman is quite willing to
let<br>
 herself be surprised half-dressed, with her hair about her
shoulders.<br>
 If her hair is all her own she scores one; but she will never
allow<br>
 herself to be seen "doing" her own rooms, or she loses her
pariostre,<br>
 --that precious SEEMING-TO-BE!</p>

<p><br>
 Madame Rabourdin was in full tide of preparation for her
Friday<br>
 dinner, standing in the midst of provisions the cook had just
fished<br>
 from the vast ocean of the markets, when Monsieur des Lupeaulx
made<br>
 his way stealthily in. The general-secretary was certainly the
last<br>
 man Madame Rabourdin expected to see, and so, when she heard his
boots<br>
 creaking in the ante-chamber, she exclaimed, impatiently, "The
hair-<br>
 dresser already!"--an exclamation as little agreeable to des
Lupeaulx<br>
 as the sight of des Lupeaulx was agreeable to her. She
immediately<br>
 escaped into her bedroom, where chaos reigned; a jumble of
furniture<br>
 to be put out of sight, with other heterogeneous articles of
more or<br>
 rather less elegance,--a domestic carnival, in short. The bold
des<br>
 Lupeaulx followed the handsome figure, so piquant did she seem
to him<br>
 in her dishabille. There is something indescribably alluring to
the<br>
 eye in a portion of flesh seen through an hiatus in the
undergarment,<br>
 more attractive far than when it rises gracefully above the
circular<br>
 curve of the velvet bodice, to the vanishing line of the
prettiest<br>
 swan's-neck that ever lover kissed before a ball. When the eye
dwells<br>
 on a woman in full dress making exhibition of her magnificent
white<br>
 shoulders, do we not fancy that we see the elegant dessert of a
grand<br>
 dinner? But the glance that glides through the disarray of
muslins<br>
 rumpled in sleep enjoys, as it were, a feast of stolen fruit
glowing<br>
 between the leaves on a garden wall.</p>

<p>"Stop! wait!" cried the pretty Parisian, bolting the door of
the<br>
 disordered room.</p>

<p>She rang for Therese, called for her daughter, the cook, and
the man-<br>
 servant, wishing she possessed the whistle of the machinist at
the<br>
 Opera. Her call, however, answered the same purpose. In a
moment,<br>
 another phenomenon! the salon assumed a piquant morning look,
quite in<br>
 keeping with the becoming toilet hastily got together by the
fugitive;<br>
 we say it to her glory, for she was evidently a clever woman, in
this<br>
 at least.</p>

<p>"You!" she said, coming forward, "at this hour? What has
happened?"</p>

<p>"Very serious things," answered des Lupeaulx. "You and I
must<br>
 understand each other now."</p>

<p>Celestine looked at the man behind his glasses, and understood
the<br>
 matter.</p>

<p>"My principle vice," she said, "is oddity. For instance, I do
not mix<br>
 up affections with politics; let us talk politics,--business, if
you<br>
 will,--the rest can come later. However, it is not really oddity
nor a<br>
 whim that forbids me to mingle ill-assorted colors and put
together<br>
 things that have no affinity, and compels me to avoid discords;
it is<br>
 my natural instinct as an artist. We women have politics of our
own."</p>

<p>Already the tones of her voice and the charm of her manners
were<br>
 producing their effect on the secretary and metamorphosing
his<br>
 roughness into sentimental courtesy; she had recalled him to
his<br>
 obligations as a lover. A clever pretty woman makes an
atmosphere<br>
 about her in which the nerves relax and the feelings soften.</p>

<p>"You are ignorant of what is happening," said des Lupeaulx,
harshly,<br>
 for he still thought it best to make a show of harshness. "Read
that."</p>

<p>He gave the two newspapers to the graceful woman, having drawn
a line<br>
 in red ink round each of the famous articles.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" she exclaimed, "but this is dreadful! Who is
this<br>
 Baudoyer?"</p>

<p>"A donkey," answered des Lupeaulx; "but, as you see, he uses
means,--<br>
 he gives monstrances; he succeeds, thanks to some clever hand
that<br>
 pulls the wires."</p>

<p>The thought of her debts crossed Madame Rabourdin's mind and
blurred<br>
 her sight, as if two lightning flashes had blinded her eyes at
the<br>
 same moment; her ears hummed under the pressure of the blood
that<br>
 began to beat in her arteries; she remained for a moment
quite<br>
 bewildered, gazing at a window which she did not see.</p>

<p>"But are you faithful to us?" she said at last, with a winning
glance<br>
 at des Lupeaulx, as if to attach him to her.</p>

<p>"That is as it may be," he replied, answering her glance with
an<br>
 interrogative look which made the poor woman blush.</p>

<p>"If you demand caution-money you may lose all," she said,
laughing; "I<br>
 thought you more magnanimous than you are. And you, you thought
me<br>
 less a person than I am,--a sort of school-girl."</p>

<p>"You have misunderstood me," he said, with a covert smile; "I
meant<br>
 that I could not assist a man who plays against me just as
l'Etourdi<br>
 played against Mascarille."</p>

<p>"What can you mean?"</p>

<p>"This will prove to you whether I am magnanimous or not."</p>

<p>He gave Madame Rabourdin the memorandum stolen by Dutocq,
pointing out<br>
 to her the passage in which her husband had so ably analyzed
him.</p>

<p>"Read that."</p>

<p>Celestine recognized the handwriting, read the paper, and
turned pale<br>
 under the blow.</p>

<p>"All the ministries, the whole service is treated in the same
way,"<br>
 said des Lupeaulx.</p>

<p>"Happily," she said, "you alone possess this document. I
cannot<br>
 explain it, even to myself."</p>

<p>"The man who stole it is not such a fool as to let me have it
without<br>
 keeping a copy for himself; he is too great a liar to admit it,
and<br>
 too clever in his business to give it up. I did not even ask him
for<br>
 it."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Your chief clerk."</p>

<p>"Dutocq! People are always punished through their kindnesses!
But,"<br>
 she added, "he is only a dog who wants a bone."</p>

<p>"Do you know what the other side offer me, poor devil of a
general-<br>
 secretary?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I owe thirty-thousand and odd miserable francs,--you will
despise me<br>
 because it isn't more, but here, I grant you, I am significant.
Well,<br>
 Baudoyer's uncle has bought up my debts, and is, doubtless,
ready to<br>
 give me a receipt for them if Baudoyer is appointed."</p>

<p>"But all that is monstrous."</p>

<p>"Not at all; it is monarchical and religious, for the Grand
Almoner is<br>
 concerned in it. Baudoyer himself must appoint Colleville in
return<br>
 for ecclesiastical assistance."</p>

<p>"What shall you do?"</p>

<p>"What will you bid me do?" he said, with charming grace,
holding out<br>
 his hand.</p>

<p>Celestine no longer thought him ugly, nor old, nor white and
chilling<br>
 as a hoar-frost, nor indeed anything that was odious and
offensive,<br>
 but she did not give him her hand. At night, in her salon, she
would<br>
 have let him take it a hundred times, but here, alone and in
the<br>
 morning, the action seemed too like a promise that might lead
her far.</p>

<p>"And they say that statesmen have no hearts!" she cried<br>
 enthusiastically, trying to hide the harshness of her refusal
under<br>
 the grace of her words. "The thought used to terrify me," she
added,<br>
 assuming an innocent, ingenuous air.</p>

<p>"What a calumny!" cried des Lupeaulx. "Only this week one of
the<br>
 stiffest of diplomatists, a man who has been in the service ever
since<br>
 he came to manhood, has married the daughter of an actress, and
has<br>
 introduced her at the most iron-bound court in Europe as to<br>
 quarterings of nobility."</p>

<p>"You will continue to support us?"</p>

<p>"I am to draw up your husband's appointment-- But no
cheating,<br>
 remember."</p>

<p>She gave him her hand to kiss, and tapped him on the cheek as
she did<br>
 so. "You are mine!" she said.</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx admired the expression.</p>

<p>[That night, at the Opera, the old coxcomb related the
incident as<br>
 follows: "A woman who did not want to tell a man she would be
his,--an<br>
 acknowledgment a well-bred woman never allows herself to
make,--<br>
 changed the words into 'You are mine.' Don't you think the
evasion<br>
 charming?"]</p>

<p>"But you must be my ally," he answered. "Now listen, your
husband has<br>
 spoken to the minister of a plan for the reform of the
administration;<br>
 the paper I have shown you is a part of that plan. I want to
know what<br>
 it is. Find out, and tell me to-night."</p>

<p>"I will," she answered, wholly unaware of the important nature
of the<br>
 errand which brought des Lupeaulx to the house that morning.</p>

<p>"Madame, the hair-dresser."</p>

<p>"At last!" thought Celestine. "I don't see how I should have
got out<br>
 of it if he had delayed much longer."</p>

<p>"You do not know to what lengths my devotion can go," said
des<br>
 Lupeaulx, rising. "You shall be invited to the first select
party<br>
 given by his Excellency's wife."</p>

<p>"Ah, you are an angel!" she cried. "And I see now how much you
love<br>
 me; you love me intelligently."</p>

<p>"To-night, dear child," he said, "I shall find out at the
Opera what<br>
 journalists are conspiring for Baudoyer, and we will measure
swords<br>
 together."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you must dine with us, will you not? I have taken
pains to<br>
 get the things you like best--"</p>

<p>"All that is so like love," said des Lupeaulx to himself as he
went<br>
 downstairs, "that I am willing to be deceived in that way for a
long<br>
 time. Well, if she IS tricking me I shall know it. I'll set
the<br>
 cleverest of all traps before the appointment is fairly signed,
and<br>
 I'll read her heart. Ah! my little cats, I know you! for, after
all,<br>
 women are just what we men are. Twenty-eight years old,
virtuous, and<br>
 living here in the rue Duphot!--a rare piece of luck and
worth<br>
 cultivating," thought the elderly butterfly as he fluttered down
the<br>
 staircase.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! that man, without his glasses, must look funny
enough<br>
 in a dressing-gown!" thought Celestine, "but the harpoon is in
his<br>
 back and he'll tow me where I want to go; I am sure now of
that<br>
 invitation. He has played his part in my comedy."</p>

<p>When, at five o'clock in the afternoon, Rabourdin came home to
dress<br>
 for dinner, his wife presided at his toilet and presently laid
before<br>
 him the fatal memorandum which, like the slipper in the
Arabian<br>
 Nights, the luckless man was fated to meet at every turn.</p>

<p>"Who gave you that?" he asked, thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"Monsieur des Lupeaulx."</p>

<p>"So he has been here!" cried Rabourdin, with a look which
would<br>
 certainly have made a guilty woman turn pale, but which
Celestine<br>
 received with unruffled brow and a laughing eye.</p>

<p>"And he is coming back to dinner," she said. "Why that
startled air?"</p>

<p>"My dear," replied Rabourdin, "I have mortally offended des
Lupeaulx;<br>
 such men never forgive, and yet he fawns upon me! Do you think I
don't<br>
 see why?"</p>

<p>"The man seems to me," she said, "to have good taste; you
can't expect<br>
 me to blame him. I really don't know anything more flattering to
a<br>
 woman than to please a worn-out palate. After--"</p>

<p>"A truce to nonsense, Celestine. Spare a much-tried man. I
cannot get<br>
 an audience of the minister, and my honor is at stake."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, no! Dutocq can have the promise of a good place
as soon<br>
 as you are named head of the division."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see what you are about, dear child," said Rabourdin;
"but the<br>
 game you are playing is just as dishonorable as the real thing
that is<br>
 going on around us. A lie is a lie, and an honest woman--"</p>

<p>"Let me use the weapons employed against us."</p>

<p>"Celestine, the more that man des Lupeaulx feels he is
foolishly<br>
 caught in a trap, the more bitter he will be against me."</p>

<p>"What if I get him dismissed altogether?"</p>

<p>Rabourdin looked at his wife in amazement.</p>

<p>"I am thinking only of your advancement; it was high time, my
poor<br>
 husband," continued Celestine. "But you are mistaking the dog
for the<br>
 game," she added, after a pause. "In a few days des Lupeaulx
will have<br>
 accomplished all that I want of him. While you are trying to
speak to<br>
 the minister, and before you can even see him on business, I
shall<br>
 have seen him and spoken with him. You are worn out in trying to
bring<br>
 that plan of your brain to birth,--a plan which you have been
hiding<br>
 from me; but you will find that in three months your wife
has<br>
 accomplished more than you have done in six years. Come, tell me
this<br>
 fine scheme of yours."</p>

<p><br>
 Rabourdin, continuing to shave, cautioned his wife not to say a
word<br>
 about his work, and after assuring her that to confide a single
idea<br>
 to des Lupeaulx would be to put the cat near the milk-jug, he
began an<br>
 explanation of his labors.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me this before, Rabourdin?" said
Celestine,<br>
 cutting her husband short at his fifth sentence. "You might have
saved<br>
 yourself a world of trouble. I can understand that a man should
be<br>
 blinded by an idea for a moment, but to nurse it up for six or
seven<br>
 years, that's a thing I cannot comprehend! You want to reduce
the<br>
 budget,--a vulgar and commonplace idea! The budget ought, on
the<br>
 contrary, to reach two hundred millions. Then, indeed, France
would be<br>
 great. If you want a new system let it be one of loans, as
Monsieur de<br>
 Nucingen keeps saying. The poorest of all treasuries is the one
with a<br>
 surplus that it never uses; the mission of a minister of finance
is to<br>
 fling gold out of the windows. It will come back to him through
the<br>
 cellars; and you, you want to hoard it! The thing to do is to
increase<br>
 the offices and all government employments, instead of reducing
them!<br>
 So far from lessening the public debt, you ought to increase
the<br>
 creditors. If the Bourbons want to reign in peace, let them
seek<br>
 creditors in the towns and villages, and place their loans
there;<br>
 above all, they ought not to let foreigners draw interest away
from<br>
 France; some day an alien nation might ask us for the capital.
Whereas<br>
 if capital and interest are held only in France, neither France
nor<br>
 credit can perish. That's what saved England. Your plan is
the<br>
 tradesman's plan. An ambitious public man should produce some
bold<br>
 scheme,--he should make himself another Law, without Law's fatal
ill-<br>
 luck; he ought to exhibit the power of credit, and show that we
should<br>
 reduce, not principal, but interest, as they do in England."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Celestine," said Rabourdin; "mix up ideas as much
as you<br>
 please, and make fun of them,--I'm accustomed to that; but
don't<br>
 criticise a work of which you know nothing as yet."</p>

<p>"Do I need," she asked, "to know a scheme the essence of which
is to<br>
 govern France with a civil service of six thousand men instead
of<br>
 twenty thousand? My dear friend, even allowing it were the plan
of a<br>
 man of genius, a king of France who attempted to carry it out
would<br>
 get himself dethroned. You can keep down a feudal aristocracy
by<br>
 levelling a few heads, but you can't subdue a hydra with
thousands.<br>
 And is it with the present ministers--between ourselves, a
wretched<br>
 crew--that you expect to carry out your reform? No, no; change
the<br>
 monetary system if you will, but do not meddle with men, with
little<br>
 men; they cry out too much, whereas gold is dumb."</p>

<p>"But, Celestine, if you will talk, and put wit before
argument, we<br>
 shall never understand each other."</p>

<p>"Understand! I understand what that paper, in which you have
analyzed<br>
 the capacities of the men in office, will lead to," she
replied,<br>
 paying no attention to what her husband said. "Good heavens! you
have<br>
 sharpened the axe to cut off your own head. Holy Virgin! why
didn't<br>
 you consult me? I could have at least prevented you from
committing<br>
 anything to writing, or, at any rate, if you insisted on putting
it to<br>
 paper, I would have written it down myself, and it should never
have<br>
 left this house. Good God! to think that he never told me!
That's what<br>
 men are! capable of sleeping with the wife of their bosom for
seven<br>
 years, and keeping a secret from her! Hiding their thoughts from
a<br>
 poor woman for seven years!--doubting her devotion!"</p>

<p>"But," cried Rabourdin, provoked, "for eleven years and more I
have<br>
 been unable to discuss anything with you because you insist on
cutting<br>
 me short and substituting your ideas for mine. You know nothing
at all<br>
 about my scheme."</p>

<p>"Nothing! I know all."</p>

<p>"Then tell it to me!" cried Rabourdin, angry for the first
time since<br>
 his marriage.</p>

<p>"There! it is half-past six o'clock; finish shaving and dress
at<br>
 once," she cried hastily, after the fashion of women when
pressed on a<br>
 point they are not ready to talk of. "I must go; we'll adjourn
the<br>
 discussion, for I don't want to be nervous on a reception-day.
Good<br>
 heavens! the poor soul!" she thought, as she left the room, "it
IS<br>
 hard to be in labor for seven years and bring forth a dead
child! And<br>
 not trust his wife!"</p>

<p>She went back into the room.</p>

<p>"If you had listened to me you would never had interceded to
keep your<br>
 chief clerk; he stole that abominable paper, and has, no doubt,
kept a<br>
 fac-simile of it. Adieu, man of genius!"</p>

<p>Then she noticed the almost tragic expression of her husband's
grief;<br>
 she felt she had gone too far, and ran to him, seized him just
as he<br>
 was, all lathered with soap-suds, and kissed him tenderly.</p>

<p>"Dear Xavier, don't be vexed," she said. "To-night, after the
people<br>
 are gone, we will study your plan; you shall speak at your
ease,--I<br>
 will listen just as long as you wish me to. Isn't that nice of
me?<br>
 What do I want better than to be the wife of Mohammed?"</p>

<p>She began to laugh; and Rabourdin laughed too, for the
soapsuds were<br>
 clinging to Celestine's lips, and her voice had the tones of
the<br>
 purest and most steadfast affection.</p>

<p>"Go and dress, dear child; and above all, don't say a word of
this to<br>
 des Lupeaulx. Swear you will not. That is the only punishment
that I<br>
 impose--"</p>

<p>"IMPOSE!" she cried. "Then I won't swear anything."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Celestine, I said in jest a really serious
thing."</p>

<p>"To-night," she said, "I mean your general-secretary to know
whom I am<br>
 really intending to attack; he has given me the means."</p>

<p>"Attack whom?"</p>

<p>"The minister," she answered, drawing himself up. "We are to
be<br>
 invited to his wife's private parties."</p>

<p>In spite of his Celestine's loving caresses, Rabourdin, as he
finished<br>
 dressing, could not prevent certain painful thoughts from
clouding his<br>
 brow.</p>

<p>"Will she ever appreciate me?" he said to himself. "She does
not even<br>
 understand that she is the sole incentive of my whole work. How
wrong-<br>
 headed, and yet how excellent a mind!--If I had not married I
might<br>
 now have been high in office and rich. I could have saved half
my<br>
 salary; my savings well-invested would have given me to-day
ten<br>
 thousand francs a year outside of my office, and I might then
have<br>
 become, through a good marriage-- Yes, that is all true," he<br>
 exclaimed, interrupting himself, "but I have Celestine and my
two<br>
 children." The man flung himself back on his happiness. To the
best of<br>
 married lives there come moments of regret. He entered the salon
and<br>
 looked around him. "There are not two women in Paris who
understand<br>
 making life pleasant as she does. To keep such a home as this
on<br>
 twelve thousand francs a year!" he thought, looking at the
flower-<br>
 stands bright with bloom, and thinking of the social enjoyments
that<br>
 were about to gratify his vanity. "She was made to be the wife
of a<br>
 minister. When I think of his Excellency's wife, and how little
she<br>
 helps him! the good woman is a comfortable middle-class dowdy,
and<br>
 when she goes to the palace or into society--" He pinched his
lips<br>
 together. Very busy men are apt to have very ignorant notions
about<br>
 household matters, and you can make them believe that a
hundred<br>
 thousand francs afford little or that twelve thousand afford
all.</p>

<p>Though impatiently expected, and in spite of the flattering
dishes<br>
 prepared for the palate of the gourmet-emeritus, des Lupeaulx
did not<br>
 come to dinner; in fact he came in very late, about midnight, an
hour<br>
 when company dwindles and conversations become intimate and<br>
 confidential. Andoche Finot, the journalist, was one of the
few<br>
 remaining guests.</p>

<p>"I now know all," said des Lupeaulx, when he was comfortably
seated on<br>
 a sofa at the corner of the fireplace, a cup of tea in his hand
and<br>
 Madame Rabourdin standing before him with a plate of sandwiches
and<br>
 some slices of cake very appropriately called "leaden cake."
"Finot,<br>
 my dear and witty friend, you can render a great service to
our<br>
 gracious queen by letting loose a few dogs upon the men we
were<br>
 talking of. You have against you," he said to Rabourdin,
lowering his<br>
 voice so as to be heard only by the three persons whom he
addressed,<br>
 "a set of usurers and priests--money and the church. The article
in<br>
 the liberal journal was instituted by an old money-lender to
whom the<br>
 paper was under obligations; but the young fellow who wrote it
cares<br>
 nothing about it. The paper is about to change hands, and in
three<br>
 days more will be on our side. The royalist opposition,--for we
have,<br>
 thanks to Monsieur de Chateaubriand, a royalist opposition, that
is to<br>
 say, royalists who have gone over to the liberals,--however,
there's<br>
 no need to discuss political matters now,--these assassins of
Charles<br>
 X. have promised me to support your appointment at the price of
our<br>
 acquiescence in one of their amendments. All my batteries are
manned.<br>
 If they threaten us with Baudoyer we shall say to the
clerical<br>
 phalanx, 'Such and such a paper and such and such men will
attack your<br>
 measures and the whole press will be against you' (for even
the<br>
 ministerial journals which I influence will be deaf and dumb,
won't<br>
 they, Finot?). 'Appoint Rabourdin, a faithful servant, and
public<br>
 opinion is with you--'"</p>

<p>"Hi, hi!" laughed Finot.</p>

<p>"So, there's no need to be uneasy," said des Lupeaulx. "I
have<br>
 arranged it all to-night; the Grand Almoner must yield."</p>

<p>"I would rather have had less hope, and you to dinner,"
whispered<br>
 Celestine, looking at him with a vexed air which might very well
pass<br>
 for an expression of wounded love.</p>

<p>"This must win my pardon," he returned, giving her an
invitation to<br>
 the ministry for the following Tuesday.</p>

<p>Celestine opened the letter, and a flush of pleasure came into
her<br>
 face. No enjoyment can be compared to that of gratified
vanity.</p>

<p>"You know what the countess's Tuesdays are," said des
Lupeaulx, with a<br>
 confidential air. "To the usual ministerial parties they are
what the<br>
 'Petit-Chateau' is to a court ball. You will be at the heart of
power!<br>
 You will see there the Comtesse Feraud, who is still in
favor<br>
 notwithstanding Louis XVIII.'s death, Delphine de Nucingen,
Madame de<br>
 Listomere, the Marquise d'Espard, and your dear Firmiani; I have
had<br>
 her invited to give you her support in case the other women
attempt to<br>
 black-ball you. I long to see you in the midst of them."</p>

<p>Celestine threw up her head like a thoroughbred before the
race, and<br>
 re-read the invitation just as Baudoyer and Saillard had re-read
the<br>
 articles about themselves in the newspapers, without being able
to<br>
 quaff enough of it.</p>

<p>"THERE first, and NEXT at the Tuileries," she said to des
Lupeaulx,<br>
 who was startled by the words and by the attitude of the
speaker, so<br>
 expressive were they of ambition and security.</p>

<p>"Can it be that I am only a stepping-stone?" he asked himself.
He<br>
 rose, and went into Madame Rabourdin's bedroom, where she
followed<br>
 him, understanding from a motion of his head that he wished to
speak<br>
 to her privately.</p>

<p>"Well, your husband's plan," he said; "what of it?"</p>

<p>"Bah! the useless nonsense of an honest man!" she replied. "He
wants<br>
 to suppress fifteen thousand offices and do the work with five
or six<br>
 thousand. You never heard of such nonsense; I will let you read
the<br>
 whole document when copied; it is written in perfect good faith.
His<br>
 analysis of the officials was prompted only by his honesty
and<br>
 rectitude,--poor dear man!"</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx was all the more reassured by the genuine laugh
which<br>
 accompanied these jesting and contemptuous words, because he was
a<br>
 judge of lying and knew that Celestine spoke in good faith.</p>

<p>"But still, what is at the bottom of it all?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, he wants to do away with the land-tax and substitute
taxes on<br>
 consumption."</p>

<p>"Why it is over a year since Francois Keller and Nucingen
proposed<br>
 some such plan, and the minister himself is thinking of a
reduction of<br>
 the land-tax."</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed Celestine, "I told him there was nothing
new in his<br>
 scheme."</p>

<p>"No; but he is on the same ground with the best financier of
the<br>
 epoch,--the Napoleon of finance. Something may come of it.
Your<br>
 husband must surely have some special ideas in his method of
putting<br>
 the scheme into practice."</p>

<p>"No, it is all commonplace," she said, with a disdainful curl
of her<br>
 lip. "Just think of governing France with five or six
thousand<br>
 offices, when what is really needed is that everybody in France
should<br>
 be personally enlisted in the support of the government."</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx seemed satisfied that Rabourdin, to whom in his
own mind<br>
 he had granted remarkable talents, was really a man of
mediocrity.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure of the appointment? You don't want a bit
of<br>
 feminine advice?" she said.</p>

<p>"You women are greater adepts than we in refined treachery,"
he said,<br>
 nodding.</p>

<p>"Well, then, say BAUDOYER to the court and clergy, to divert
suspicion<br>
 and put them to sleep, and then, at the last moment, write
RABOURDIN."</p>

<p>"There are some women who say YES as long as they need a man,
and NO<br>
 when he has played his part," returned des Lupeaulx,
significantly.</p>

<p>"I know they do," she answered, laughing; "but they are very
foolish,<br>
 for in politics everything recommences. Such proceedings may do
with<br>
 fools, but you are a man of sense. In my opinion the greatest
folly<br>
 any one can commit is to quarrel with a clever man."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," said des Lupeaulx, "for such a man
pardons. The<br>
 real danger is with the petty spiteful natures who have nothing
to do<br>
 but study revenge,--I spend my life among them."</p>

<p>When all the guests were gone, Rabourdin came into his wife's
room,<br>
 and after asking for her strict attention, he explained his plan
and<br>
 made her see that it did not cut down the revenue but on the
contrary<br>
 increased it; he showed her in what ways the public funds
were<br>
 employed, and how the State could increase tenfold the
circulation of<br>
 money by putting its own, in the proportion of a third, or a
quarter,<br>
 into the expenditures which would be sustained by private or
local<br>
 interests. He finally proved to her plainly that his plan was
not mere<br>
 theory, but a system teeming with methods of execution.
Celestine,<br>
 brightly enthusiastic, sprang into her husband's arms and sat
upon his<br>
 knee in the chimney-corner.</p>

<p>"At last I find the husband of my dreams!" she cried. "My
ignorance of<br>
 your real merit has saved you from des Lupeaulx's claws. I
calumniated<br>
 you to him gloriously and in good faith."</p>

<p>The man wept with joy. His day of triumph had come at last.
Having<br>
 labored for many years to satisfy his wife, he found himself a
great<br>
 man in the eyes of his sole public.</p>

<p>"To one who knows how good you are, how tender, how equable in
anger,<br>
 how loving, you are tenfold greater still. But," she added, "a
man of<br>
 genius is always more or less a child; and you are a child, a
dearly<br>
 beloved child," she said, caressing him. Then she drew that
invitation<br>
 from that particular spot where women put what they sacredly
hide, and<br>
 showed it to him.</p>

<p>"Here is what I wanted," she said; "Des Lupeaulx has put me
face to<br>
 face with the minister, and were he a man of iron, his
Excellency<br>
 shall be made for a time to bend the knee to me."</p>

<p><br>
 The next day Celestine began her preparations for entrance into
the<br>
 inner circle of the ministry. It was her day of triumph, her
own!<br>
 Never courtesan took such pains with herself as this honest
woman<br>
 bestowed upon her person. No dressmaker was ever so tormented as
hers.<br>
 Madame Rabourdin forgot nothing. She went herself to the stable
where<br>
 she hired carriages, and chose a coupe that was neither old,
nor<br>
 bourgeois, nor showy. Her footman, like the footmen of great
houses,<br>
 had the dress and appearance of a master. About ten on the
evening of<br>
 the eventful Tuesday, she left home in a charming full
mourning<br>
 attire. Her hair was dressed with jet grapes of exquisite
workmanship,<br>
 --an ornament costing three thousand francs, made by Fossin for
an<br>
 Englishwoman who had left Paris before it was finished. The
leaves<br>
 were of stamped iron-work, as light as the vine-leaves
themselves, and<br>
 the artist had not forgotten the graceful tendrils, which twined
in<br>
 the wearer's curls just as, in nature, they catch upon the
branches.<br>
 The bracelets, necklace, and earrings were all what is called
Berlin<br>
 iron-work; but these delicate arabesques were made in Vienna,
and<br>
 seemed to have been fashioned by the fairies who, the stories
tell us,<br>
 are condemned by a jealous Carabosse to collect the eyes of
ants, or<br>
 weave a fabric so diaphanous that a nutshell can contain it.
Madame<br>
 Rabourdin's graceful figure, made more slender still by the
black<br>
 draperies, was shown to advantage by a carefully cut dress, the
two<br>
 sides of which met at the shoulders in a single strap without
sleeves.<br>
 At every motion she seemed, like a butterfly, to be about to
leave her<br>
 covering; but the gown held firmly on by some contrivance of
the<br>
 wonderful dressmaker. The robe was of mousseline de laine--a
material<br>
 which the manufacturers had not yet sent to the Paris markets;
a<br>
 delightful stuff which some months later was to have a wild
success, a<br>
 success which went further and lasted longer than most
French<br>
 fashions. The actual economy of mousseline de laine, which needs
no<br>
 washing, has since injured the sale of cotton fabrics enough
to<br>
 revolutionize the Rouen manufactories. Celestine's little
feet,<br>
 covered with fine silk stockings and turk-satin shoes (for
silk-satin<br>
 is inadmissible in deep mourning) were of elegant proportions.
Thus<br>
 dressed, she was very handsome. Her complexion, beautified by a
bran-<br>
 bath, was softly radiant. Her eyes, suffused with the light of
hope,<br>
 and sparkling with intelligence, justified her claims to the<br>
 superiority which des Lupeaulx, proud and happy on this
occasion,<br>
 asserted for her.</p>

<p>She entered the room well (women will understand the meaning
of that<br>
 expression), bowed gracefully to the minister's wife, with a
happy<br>
 mixture of deference and of self-respect, and gave no offence by
a<br>
 certain reliance on her own dignity; for every beautiful woman
has the<br>
 right to seem a queen. With the minister himself she took the
pretty<br>
 air of sauciness which women may properly allow themselves with
men,<br>
 even when they are grand dukes. She reconnoitred the field, as
it<br>
 were, while taking her seat, and saw that she was in the midst
of one<br>
 of those select parties of few persons, where the women eye
and<br>
 appraise each other, and every word said echoes in all ears;
where<br>
 every glance is a stab, and conversation a duel with witnesses;
where<br>
 all that is commonplace seems commoner still, and where every
form of<br>
 merit or distinction is silently accepted as though it were
the<br>
 natural level of all present. Rabourdin betook himself to
the<br>
 adjoining salon in which a few persons were playing cards; and
there<br>
 he planted himself on exhibition, as it were, which proved that
he was<br>
 not without social intelligence.</p>

<p>"My dear," said the Marquise d'Espard to the Comtesse Feraud,
Louis<br>
 XVIII.'s last mistress, "Paris is certainly unique. It
produces--<br>
 whence and how, who knows?--women like this person, who seems
ready to<br>
 will and to do anything."</p>

<p>"She really does will, and does do everything," put in des
Lupeaulx,<br>
 puffed up with satisfaction.</p>

<p>At this moment the wily Madame Rabourdin was courting the
minister's<br>
 wife. Carefully coached the evening before by des Lupeaulx, who
knew<br>
 all the countess's weak spots, she was flattering her without
seeming<br>
 to do so. Every now and then she kept silence; for des Lupeaulx,
in<br>
 love as he was, knew her defects, and said to her the night
before,<br>
 "Be careful not to talk too much,"--words which were really an
immense<br>
 proof of attachment. Bertrand Barrere left behind him this
sublime<br>
 axiom: "Never interrupt a woman when dancing to give her
advice," to<br>
 which we may add (to make this chapter of the female code
complete),<br>
 "Never blame a woman for scattering her pearls."</p>

<p>The conversation became general. From time to time Madame
Rabourdin<br>
 joined in, just as a well-trained cat puts a velvet paw on
her<br>
 mistress's laces with the claws carefully drawn in. The
minister, in<br>
 matters of the heart, had few emotions. There was not
another<br>
 statesman under the Restoration who had so completely done
with<br>
 gallantry as he; even the opposition papers, the "Miroir,"
"Pandora,"<br>
 and "Figaro," could not find a single throbbing artery with
which to<br>
 reproach him. Madame Rabourdin knew this, but she knew also
that<br>
 ghosts return to old castles, and she had taken it into her head
to<br>
 make the minister jealous of the happiness which des Lupeaulx
was<br>
 appearing to enjoy. The latter's throat literally gurgled with
the<br>
 name of his divinity. To launch his supposed mistress
successfully, he<br>
 was endeavoring to persuade the Marquise d'Espard, Madame de
Nucingen,<br>
 and the countess, in an eight-ear conversation, that they had
better<br>
 admit Madame Rabourdin to their coalition; and Madame de Camps
was<br>
 supporting him. At the end of the hour the minister's vanity
was<br>
 greatly tickled; Madame Rabourdin's cleverness pleased him, and
she<br>
 had won his wife, who, delighted with the siren, invited her to
come<br>
 to all her receptions whenever she pleased.</p>

<p>"For your husband, my dear," she said, "will soon be director;
the<br>
 minister intends to unite the two divisions and place them under
one<br>
 director; you will then be one of us, you know."</p>

<p>His Excellency carried off Madame Rabourdin on his arm to show
her a<br>
 certain room, which was then quite celebrated because the
opposition<br>
 journals blamed him for decorating it extravagantly; and
together they<br>
 laughed over the absurdities of journalism.</p>

<p>"Madame, you really must give the countess and myself the
pleasure of<br>
 seeing you here often."</p>

<p>And he went on with a round of ministerial compliments.</p>

<p>"But, Monseigneur," she replied, with one of those glances
which women<br>
 hold in reserve, "it seems to me that that depends on you."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"You alone can give me the right to come here."</p>

<p>"Pray explain."</p>

<p>"No; I said to myself before I came that I would certainly not
have<br>
 the bad taste to seem a petitioner."</p>

<p>"No, no, speak freely. Places asked in this way are never out
of<br>
 place," said the minister, laughing; for there is no jest too
silly to<br>
 amuse a solemn man.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I must tell you plainly that the wife of the head
of a<br>
 bureau is out of place here; a director's wife is not."</p>

<p>"That point need not be considered," said the minister. "your
husband<br>
 is indispensable to the administration; he is already
appointed."</p>

<p>"Is that a veritable fact?"</p>

<p>"Would you like to see the papers in my study? They are
already drawn<br>
 up."</p>

<p>"Then," she said, pausing in a corner where she was alone with
the<br>
 minister, whose eager attentions were now very marked, "let me
tell<br>
 you that I can make you a return."</p>

<p>She was on the point of revealing her husband's plan, when
des<br>
 Lupeaulx, who had glided noiselessly up to them, uttered an
angry<br>
 sound, which meant that he did not wish to appear to have
overheard<br>
 what, in fact, he had been listening to. The minister gave an
ill-<br>
 tempered look at the old beau, who, impatient to win his reward,
had<br>
 hurried, beyond all precedent, the preliminary work of the<br>
 appointment. He had carried the papers to his Excellency that
evening,<br>
 and desired to take himself, on the morrow, the news of the<br>
 appointment to her whom he was now endeavoring to exhibit as
his<br>
 mistress. Just then the minister's valet approached des Lupeaulx
in a<br>
 mysterious manner, and told him that his own servant wished him
to<br>
 deliver to him at once a letter of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>The general-secretary went up to a lamp and read a note thus
worded:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to my custom, I am waiting in your ante-chamber to
see<br>
 you; you have not a moment to lose if you wish to come to
terms<br>
 with</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,<br>
 Gobseck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
 The secretary shuddered when he saw the signature, which we
regret we<br>
 cannot give in fac-simile, for it would be valuable to those who
like<br>
 to guess character from what may be called the physiognomy
of<br>
 signature. If ever a hieroglyphic sign expressed an animal, it
was<br>
 assuredly this written name, in which the first and the final
letter<br>
 approached each other like the voracious jaws of a
shark,--insatiable,<br>
 always open, seeking whom to devour, both strong and weak. As
for the<br>
 wording of the note, the spirit of usury alone could have
inspired a<br>
 sentence so imperative, so insolently curt and cruel, which said
all<br>
 and revealed nothing. Those who had never heard of Gobseck would
have<br>
 felt, on reading words which compelled him to whom they were
addressed<br>
 to obey, yet gave no order, the presence of the implacable
money-<br>
 lender of the rue des Gres. Like a dog called to heel by the
huntsman,<br>
 des Lupeaulx left his present quest and went immediately to his
own<br>
 rooms, thinking of his hazardous position. Imagine a general to
whom<br>
 an aide-de-camp rides up and says: "The enemy with thirty
thousand<br>
 fresh troops is attacking on our right flank."</p>

<p><br>
 A very few words will serve to explain this sudden arrival of
Gigonnet<br>
 and Gobseck on the field of battle,--for des Lupeaulx found them
both<br>
 waiting. At eight o'clock that evening, Martin Falleix,
returning on<br>
 the wings of the wind,--thanks to three francs to the postboys
and a<br>
 courier in advance,--had brought back with him the deeds of
the<br>
 property signed the night before. Taken at once to the Cafe
Themis by<br>
 Mitral, these securities passed into the hands of the two
usurers, who<br>
 hastened (though on foot) to the ministry. It was past eleven
o'clock.<br>
 Des Lupeaulx trembled when he saw those sinister faces, emitting
a<br>
 simultaneous look as direct as a pistol shot and as brilliant as
the<br>
 flash itself.</p>

<p>"What is it, my masters?" he said.</p>

<p>The two extortioners continued cold and motionless. Gigonnet
silently<br>
 pointed to the documents in his hand, and then at the
servant.</p>

<p>"Come into my study," said des Lupeaulx, dismissing his valet
by a<br>
 sign.</p>

<p>"You understand French very well," remarked Gigonnet,
approvingly.</p>

<p>"Have you come here to torment a man who enabled each of you
to make a<br>
 couple of hundred thousand francs?"</p>

<p>"And who will help us to make more, I hope," said
Gigonnet.</p>

<p>"Some new affair?" asked des Lupeaulx. "If you want me to help
you,<br>
 consider that I recollect the past."</p>

<p>"So do we," answered Gigonnet.</p>

<p>"My debts must be paid," said des Lupeaulx, disdainfully, so
as not to<br>
 seem worsted at the outset.</p>

<p>"True," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>"Let us come to the point, my son," said Gigonnet. "Don't
stiffen your<br>
 chin in your cravat; with us all that is useless. Take these
deeds and<br>
 read them."</p>

<p>The two usurers took a mental inventory of des Lupeaulx's
study while<br>
 he read with amazement and stupefaction a deed of purchase
which<br>
 seemed wafted to him from the clouds by angels.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you have a pair of intelligent business
agents in<br>
 Gobseck and me?" asked Gigonnet.</p>

<p>"But tell me, to what do I owe such able co-operation?" said
des<br>
 Lupeaulx, suspicious and uneasy.</p>

<p>"We knew eight days ago a fact that without us you would not
have<br>
 known till to-morrow morning. The president of the chamber
of<br>
 commerce, a deputy, as you know, feels himself obliged to
resign."</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx's eyes dilated, and were as big as daisies.</p>

<p>"Your minister has been tricking you about this event," said
the<br>
 concise Gobseck.</p>

<p>"You master me," said the general-secretary, bowing with an
air of<br>
 profound respect, bordering however, on sarcasm.</p>

<p>"True," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>"Can you mean to strangle me?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"Well, then, begin your work, executioners," said the
secretary,<br>
 smiling.</p>

<p>"You will see," resumed Gigonnet, "that the sum total of your
debts is<br>
 added to the sum loaned by us for the purchase of the property;
we<br>
 have bought them up."</p>

<p>"Here are the deeds," said Gobseck, taking from the pocket of
his<br>
 greenish overcoat a number of legal papers.</p>

<p>"You have three years in which to pay off the whole sum,"
said<br>
 Gigonnet.</p>

<p>"But," said des Lupeaulx, frightened at such kindness, and
also by so<br>
 apparently fantastic an arrangement. "What do you want of
me?"</p>

<p>"La Billardiere's place for Baudoyer," said Gigonnet,
quickly.</p>

<p>"That's a small matter, though it will be next to impossible
for me to<br>
 do it," said des Lupeaulx. "I have just tied my hands."</p>

<p>"Bite the cords with your teeth," said Gigonnet.</p>

<p>"They are sharp," added Gobseck.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked des Lupeaulx.</p>

<p>"We keep the title-deeds of the property till the debts are
paid,"<br>
 said Gigonnet, putting one of the papers before des Lupeaulx;
"and if<br>
 the matter of the appointment is not satisfactorily arranged
within<br>
 six days our names will be substituted in place of yours."</p>

<p>"You are deep," cried the secretary.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>"And this is all?" exclaimed des Lupeaulx.</p>

<p>"All," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>"You agree?" asked Gigonnet.</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Well, then, sign this power of attorney. Within two days
Baudoyer is<br>
 to be nominated; within six your debts will be cleared off,
and--"</p>

<p>"And what?" asked des Lupeaulx.</p>

<p>"We guarantee--"</p>

<p>"Guarantee!--what?" said the secretary, more and more
astonished.</p>

<p>"Your election to the Chamber," said Gigonnet, rising on his
heels.<br>
 "We have secured a majority of fifty-two farmers' and
mechanics'<br>
 votes, which will be thrown precisely as those who lend you this
money<br>
 dictate."</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx wrung Gigonnet's hand.</p>

<p>"It is only such as we who never misunderstand each other," he
said;<br>
 "this is what I call doing business. I'll make you a return
gift."</p>

<p>"Right," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Gigonnet.</p>

<p>"The cross of the Legion of honor for your imbecile of a
nephew."</p>

<p>"Good," said Gigonnet, "I see you know him well."</p>

<p>The pair took leave of des Lupeaulx, who conducted them to
the<br>
 staircase.</p>

<p>"They must be secret envoys from foreign powers," whispered
the<br>
 footmen to each other.</p>

<p>Once in the street, the two usurers looked at each other under
a<br>
 street lamp and laughed.</p>

<p>"He will owe us nine thousand francs interest a year," said
Gigonnet;<br>
 "that property doesn't bring him in five."</p>

<p>"He is under our thumb for a long time," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>"He'll build; he'll commit extravagancies," continued
Gigonnet;<br>
 "Falleix will get his land."</p>

<p>"His interest is only to be made deputy; the old fox laughs at
the<br>
 rest," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>"Hey! hey!"</p>

<p>"Hi! hi!"</p>

<p>These dry little exclamations served as a laugh to the two old
men,<br>
 who took their way back (always on foot) to the Cafe Themis.</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx returned to the salon and found Madame Rabourdin
sailing<br>
 with the wind of success, and very charming; while his
Excellency,<br>
 usually so gloomy, showed a smooth and gracious countenance.</p>

<p>"She performs miracles," thought des Lupeaulx. "What a
wonderfully<br>
 clever woman! I must get to the bottom of her heart."</p>

<p>"Your little lady is decidedly handsome," said the Marquise to
the<br>
 secretary; "now if she only had your name."</p>

<p>"Yes, her defect is that she is the daughter of an auctioneer.
She<br>
 will fail for want of birth," replied des Lupeaulx, with a cold
manner<br>
 that contrasted strangely with the ardor of his remarks about
Madame<br>
 Rabourdin not half an hour earlier.</p>

<p>The marquise looked at him fixedly.</p>

<p>"The glance you gave them did not escape me," she said,
motioning<br>
 towards the minister and Madame Rabourdin; "it pierced the mask
of<br>
 your spectacles. How amusing you both are, to quarrel over that
bone!"</p>

<p>As the marquise turned to leave the room the minister joined
her and<br>
 escorted her to the door.</p>

<p>"Well," said des Lupeaulx to Madame Rabourdin, "what do you
think of<br>
 his Excellency?"</p>

<p>"He is charming. We must know these poor ministers to
appreciate<br>
 them," she added, slightly raising her voice so as to be heard
by his<br>
 Excellency's wife. "The newspapers and the opposition calumnies
are so<br>
 misleading about men in politics that we are all more or
less<br>
 influenced by them; but such prejudices turn to the advantage
of<br>
 statesmen when we come to know them personally."</p>

<p>"He is very good-looking," said des Lupeaulx.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I assure you he is quite lovable," she said,
heartily.</p>

<p>"Dear child," said des Lupeaulx, with a genial, caressing
manner; "you<br>
 have actually done the impossible."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Resuscitated the dead. I did not think that man had a heart;
ask his<br>
 wife. But he may have just enough for a passing fancy.
Therefore<br>
 profit by it. Come this way, and don't be surprised." He led
Madame<br>
 Rabourdin into the boudoir, placed her on a sofa, and sat down
beside<br>
 her. "You are very sly," he said, "and I like you the better for
it.<br>
 Between ourselves, you are a clever woman. Des Lupeaulx served
to<br>
 bring you into this house, and that is all you wanted of him,
isn't<br>
 it? Now when a woman decides to love a man for what she can get
out of<br>
 him it is better to take a sexagenarian Excellency than a<br>
 quadragenarian secretary; there's more profit and less
annoyance. I'm<br>
 a man with spectacles, grizzled hair, worn out with
dissipation,--a<br>
 fine lover, truly! I tell myself all this again and again. It
must be<br>
 admitted, of course, that I can sometimes be useful, but
never<br>
 agreeable. Isn't that so? A man must be a fool if he cannot
reason<br>
 about himself. You can safely admit the truth and let me see to
the<br>
 depths of your heart; we are partners, not lovers. If I show
some<br>
 tenderness at times, you are too superior a woman to pay any
attention<br>
 to such follies; you will forgive me,--you are not a
school-girl, or a<br>
 bourgeoise of the rue Saint-Denis. Bah! you and I are too well
brought<br>
 up for that. There's the Marquise d'Espard who has just left the
room;<br>
 this is precisely what she thinks and does. She and I came to
an<br>
 understanding two years ago [the coxcomb!], and now she has only
to<br>
 write me a line and say, 'My dear des Lupeaulx, you will oblige
me by<br>
 doing such and such a thing,' and it is done at once. We are
engaged<br>
 at this very moment in getting a commission of lunacy on her
husband.<br>
 Ah! you women, you can get what you want by the bestowal of a
few<br>
 favors. Well, then, my dear child, bewitch the minister. I'll
help<br>
 you; it is my interest to do so. Yes, I wish he had a woman who
could<br>
 influence him; he wouldn't escape me,--for he does escape me
quite<br>
 often, and the reason is that I hold him only through his
intellect.<br>
 Now if I were one with a pretty woman who was also intimate with
him,<br>
 I should hold him by his weaknesses, and that is much the
firmest<br>
 grip. Therefore, let us be friends, you and I, and share the<br>
 advantages of the conquest you are making."</p>

<p><br>
 Madame Rabourdin listened in amazement to this singular
profession of<br>
 rascality. The apparent artlessness of this political
swindler<br>
 prevented her from suspecting a trick.</p>

<p>"Do you believe he really thinks of me?" she asked, falling
into the<br>
 trap.</p>

<p>"I know it; I am certain of it."</p>

<p>"Is it true that Rabourdin's appointment is signed?"</p>

<p>"I gave him the papers this morning. But it is not enough that
your<br>
 husband should be made director; he must be Master of
petitions."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, then, go back to the salon and coquette a little more
with his<br>
 Excellency."</p>

<p>"It is true," she said, "that I never fully understood you
till<br>
 to-night. There is nothing commonplace about YOU."</p>

<p>"We will be two old friends," said des Lupeaulx, "and suppress
all<br>
 tender nonsense and tormenting love; we will take things as they
did<br>
 under the Regency. Ah! they had plenty of wit and wisdom in
those<br>
 days!"</p>

<p>"You are really strong; you deserve my admiration," she said,
smiling,<br>
 and holding out her hand to him, "one does more for one's
friend, you<br>
 know, than for one's--"</p>

<p>She left him without finishing her sentence.</p>

<p>"Dear creature!" thought des Lupeaulx, as he saw her approach
the<br>
 minister, "des Lupeaulx has no longer the slightest remorse in
turning<br>
 against you. To-morrow evening when you offer me a cup of tea,
you<br>
 will be offering me a thing I no longer care for. All is over.
Ah!<br>
 when a man is forty years of age women may take pains to catch
him,<br>
 but they won't love him."</p>

<p>He looked himself over in a mirror, admitting honestly that
though he<br>
 did very well as a politician he was a wreck on the shores of
Cythera.<br>
 At the same moment Madame Rabourdin was gathering herself
together for<br>
 a becoming exit. She wished to make a last graceful impression
on the<br>
 minds of all, and she succeeded. Contrary to the usual custom
in<br>
 society, every one cried out as soon as she was gone, "What a
charming<br>
 woman!" and the minister himself took her to the outer door.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure you will think of me to-morrow," he said,
alluding to<br>
 the appointment.</p>

<p>"There are so few high functionaries who have agreeable
wives,"<br>
 remarked his Excellency on re-entering the room, "that I am very
well<br>
 satisfied with our new acquisition."</p>

<p>"Don't you think her a little overpowering?" said des Lupeaulx
with a<br>
 piqued air.</p>

<p>The women present all exchanged expressive glances; the
rivalry<br>
 between the minister and his secretary amused them and
instigated one<br>
 of those pretty little comedies which Parisian women play so
well.<br>
 They excited and led on his Excellency and des Lupeaulx by a
series of<br>
 comments on Madame Rabourdin: one thought her too studied in
manner,<br>
 too eager to appear clever; another compared the graces of the
middle<br>
 classes with the manners of high life, while des Lupeaulx
defended his<br>
 pretended mistress as we all defend an enemy in society.</p>

<p>"Do her justice, ladies," he said; "is it not extraordinary
that the<br>
 daughter of an auctioneer should appear as well as she does? See
where<br>
 she came from, and what she is. She will end in the Tuileries;
that is<br>
 what she intends,--she told me so."</p>

<p>"Suppose she is the daughter of an auctioneer," said the
Comtesse<br>
 Feraud, smiling, "that will not hinder her husband's rise to
power."</p>

<p>"Not in these days, you mean," said the minister's wife,
tightening<br>
 her lips.</p>

<p>"Madame," said his Excellency to the countess, sternly,
"such<br>
 sentiments and such speeches lead to revolutions; unhappily, the
court<br>
 and the great world do not restrain them. You would hardly
believe,<br>
 however, how the injudicious conduct of the aristocracy in
this<br>
 respect displeases certain clear-sighted personages at the
palace. If<br>
 I were a great lord, instead of being, as I am, a mere
country<br>
 gentleman who seems to be placed where he is to transact your
business<br>
 for you, the monarchy would not be as insecure as I now think it
is.<br>
 What becomes of a throne which does not bestow dignity on those
who<br>
 administer its government? We are far indeed from the days when
a king<br>
 could make men great at will,--such men as Louvois, Colbert,<br>
 Richelieu, Jeannin, Villeroy, Sully,--Sully, in his origin, was
no<br>
 greater than I. I speak to you thus because we are here in
private<br>
 among ourselves. I should be very paltry indeed if I were
personally<br>
 offended by such speeches. After all, it is for us and not for
others<br>
 to make us great."</p>

<p>"You are appointed, dear," cried Celestine, pressing her
husband's<br>
 hand as they drove away. "If it had not been for des Lupeaulx I
should<br>
 have explained your scheme to his Excellency. But I will do it
next<br>
 Tuesday, and it will help the further matter of making you
Master of<br>
 petitions."</p>

<p>In the life of every woman there comes a day when she shines
in all<br>
 her glory; a day which gives her an unfading recollection to
which she<br>
 recurs with happiness all her life. As Madame Rabourdin took off
one<br>
 by one the ornaments of her apparel, she thought over the events
of<br>
 this evening, and marked the day among the triumphs and glories
of her<br>
 life,--all her beauties had been seen and envied, she had been
praised<br>
 and flattered by the minister's wife, delighted thus to make the
other<br>
 women jealous of her; but, above all, her grace and vanities had
shone<br>
 to the profit of conjugal love. Her husband was appointed.</p>

<p>"Did you think I looked well to-night?" she said to him,
joyously.</p>

<p>At the same instant Mitral, waiting at the Cafe Themis, saw
the two<br>
 usurers returning, but was unable to perceive the slightest<br>
 indications of the result on their impassible faces.</p>

<p>"What of it?" he said, when they were all seated at table.</p>

<p>"Same as ever," replied Gigonnet, rubbing his hands, "victory
with<br>
 gold."</p>

<p>"True," said Gobseck.</p>

<p>Mitral took a cabriolet and went straight to the Saillards
and<br>
 Baudoyers, who were still playing boston at a late hour. No one
was<br>
 present but the Abbe Gaudron. Falleix, half-dead with the
fatigue of<br>
 his journey, had gone to bed.</p>

<p>"You will be appointed, nephew," said Mitral; "and there's a
surprise<br>
 in store for you."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Saillard.</p>

<p>"The cross of the Legion of honor?" cried Mitral.</p>

<p>"God protects those who guard his altars," said Gaudron.</p>

<p>Thus the Te Deum was sung with equal joy and confidence in
both camps.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h4>FORWARD, MOLLUSKS!</h4>

<p>The next day, Wednesday, Monsieur Rabourdin was to transact
business<br>
 with the minister, for he had filled the late La Billardiere's
place<br>
 since the beginning of the latter's illness. On such days the
clerks<br>
 came punctually, the servants were specially attentive, there
was<br>
 always a certain excitement in the offices on these
signing-days,--and<br>
 why, nobody ever knew. On this occasion the three servants were
at<br>
 their post, flattering themselves they should get a few fees;
for a<br>
 rumor of Rabourdin's nomination had spread through the ministry
the<br>
 night before, thanks to Dutocq. Uncle Antoine and Laurent had
donned<br>
 their full uniform, when, at a quarter to eight, des
Lupeaulx's<br>
 servant came in with a letter, which he begged Antoine to
give<br>
 secretly to Dutocq, saying that the general-secretary had
ordered him<br>
 to deliver it without fail at Monsieur Dutocq's house by
seven<br>
 o'clock.</p>

<p><br>
 "I'm sure I don't know how it happened," he said, "but I
overslept<br>
 myself. I've only just waked up, and he'd play the devil's
tattoo on<br>
 me if he knew the letter hadn't gone. I know a famous secret,
Antoine;<br>
 but don't say anything about it to the clerks if I tell you;
promise?<br>
 He would send me off if he knew I had said a single word; he
told me<br>
 so."</p>

<p>"What's inside the letter?" asked Antoine, eying it.</p>

<p>"Nothing; I looked this way--see."</p>

<p>He made the letter gape open, and showed Antoine that there
was<br>
 nothing but blank paper to be seen.</p>

<p>"This is going to be a great day for you, Laurent," went on
the<br>
 secretary's man. "You are to have a new director. Economy must
be the<br>
 order of the day, for they are going to unite the two divisions
under<br>
 one director--you fellows will have to look out!"</p>

<p>"Yes, nine clerks are put on the retired list," said Dutocq,
who came<br>
 in at the moment; "how did you hear that?"</p>

<p>Antoine gave him the letter, and he had no sooner opened it
than he<br>
 rushed headlong downstairs in the direction of the secretary's
office.</p>

<p>The bureaus Rabourdin and Baudoyer, after idling and gossiping
since<br>
 the death of Monsieur de la Billardiere, were now recovering
their<br>
 usual official look and the dolce far niente habits of a
government<br>
 office. Nevertheless, the approaching end of the year did cause
rather<br>
 more application among the clerks, just as porters and servants
become<br>
 at that season more unctuously civil. They all came punctually,
for<br>
 one thing; more remained after four o'clock than was usual at
other<br>
 times. It was not forgotten that fees and gratuities depend on
the<br>
 last impressions made upon the minds of masters. The news of the
union<br>
 of the two divisions, that of La Billardiere and that of
Clergeot,<br>
 under one director, had spread through the various offices. The
number<br>
 of the clerks to be retired was known, but all were in ignorance
of<br>
 the names. It was taken for granted that Poiret would not be
replaced,<br>
 and that would be a retrenchment. Little La Billardiere had
already<br>
 departed. Two new supernumeraries had made their appearance,
and,<br>
 alarming circumstance! they were both sons of deputies. The news
told<br>
 about in the offices the night before, just as the clerks
were<br>
 dispersing, agitated all minds, and for the first half-hour
after<br>
 arrival in the morning they stood around the stoves and talked
it<br>
 over. But earlier than that, Dutocq, as we have seen, had rushed
to<br>
 des Lupeaulx on receiving his note, and found him dressing.
Without<br>
 laying down his razor, the general-secretary cast upon his
subordinate<br>
 the glance of a general issuing an order.</p>

<p>"Are we alone?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Very good. March on Rabourdin; forward! steady! Of course you
kept a<br>
 copy of that paper?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You understand me? Inde iroe! There must be a general hue and
cry<br>
 raised against him. Find some way to start a clamor--"</p>

<p>"I could get a man to make a caricature, but I haven't five
hundred<br>
 francs to pay for it."</p>

<p>"Who would make it?"</p>

<p>"Bixou."</p>

<p>"He shall have a thousand and be under-head-clerk to
Colleville, who<br>
 will arrange with them; tell him so."</p>

<p>"But he wouldn't believe it on nothing more than my word."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to make me compromise myself? Either do the
thing or<br>
 let it alone; do you hear me?"</p>

<p>"If Monsieur Baudoyer were director--"</p>

<p>"Well, he will be. Go now, and make haste; you have no time to
lose.<br>
 Go down the back-stairs; I don't want people to know you have
just<br>
 seen me."</p>

<p>While Dutocq was returning to the clerks' office and asking
himself<br>
 how he could best incite a clamor against his chief without<br>
 compromising himself, Bixiou rushed to the Rabourdin office for
a word<br>
 of greeting. Believing that he had lost his bet the incorrigible
joker<br>
 thought it amusing to pretend that he had won it.</p>

<p>Bixiou [mimicking Phellion's voice]. "Gentlemen, I salute you
with a<br>
 collective how d'ye do, and I appoint Sunday next for the dinner
at<br>
 the Rocher de Cancale. But a serious question presents itself.
Is that<br>
 dinner to include the clerks who are dismissed?"</p>

<p>Poiret. "And those who retire?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Not that I care, for it isn't I who pay."
[General<br>
 stupefaction.] "Baudoyer is appointed. I think I already hear
him<br>
 calling Laurent" [mimicking Baudoyer], "Laurent! lock up my
hair-<br>
 shirt, and my scourge." [They all roar with laughter.] "Yes,
yes, he<br>
 laughs well who laughs last. Gentlemen, there's a great deal in
that<br>
 anagram of Colleville's. 'Xavier Rabourdin, chef de
bureau--D'abord<br>
 reva bureaux, e-u fin riche.' If I were named 'Charles X., par
la<br>
 grace de Dieu roi de France et de Navarre,' I should tremble in
my<br>
 shoes at the fate those letters anagrammatize."</p>

<p>Thuillier. "Look here! are you making fun?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "No, I am not. Rabourdin resigns in a rage at finding
Baudoyer<br>
 appointed director."</p>

<p>Vimeux [entering.] "Nonsense, no such thing! Antoine (to whom
I have<br>
 just been paying forty francs that I owed him) tells me that
Monsieur<br>
 and Madame Rabourdin were at the minister's private party last
night<br>
 and stayed till midnight. His Excellency escorted Madame
Rabourdin to<br>
 the staircase. It seems she was divinely dressed. In short, it
is<br>
 quite certain that Rabourdin is to be director. Riffe, the
secretary's<br>
 copying clerk, told me he sat up all the night before to draw
the<br>
 papers; it is no longer a secret. Monsieur Clergeot is retired.
After<br>
 thirty years' service that's no misfortune. Monsieur Cochlin,
who is<br>
 rich--"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "By cochineal."</p>

<p>Vimeux. "Yes, cochineal; he's a partner in the house of
Matifat, rue<br>
 des Lombards. Well, he is retired; so is Poiret. Neither is to
be<br>
 replaced. So much is certain; the rest is all conjecture.
The<br>
 appointment of Monsieur Rabourdin is to be announced this
morning;<br>
 they are afraid of intrigues."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "What intrigues?"</p>

<p>Fleury. "Baudoyer's, confound him! The priests uphold him;
here's<br>
 another article in the liberal journal,--only half a dozen
lines, but<br>
 they are queer" [reads]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Certain persons spoke last night in the lobby of the
Opera-house<br>
 of the return of Monsieur de Chateaubriand to the ministry,
basing<br>
 their opinion on the choice made of Monsieur Rabourdin (the<br>
 protege of friends of the noble viscount) to fill the office
for<br>
 which Monsieur Baudoyer was first selected. The clerical party
is<br>
 not likely to withdraw unless in deference to the great
writer.</p>

<p>"Blackguards!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dutocq [entering, having heard the whole discussion].
"Blackguards!<br>
 Who? Rabourdin? Then you know the news?"</p>

<p><br>
 Fleury [rolling his eyes savagely]. "Rabourdin a blackguard! Are
you<br>
 mad, Dutocq? do you want a ball in your brains to give them
weight?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "I said nothing against Monsieur Rabourdin; only it
has just<br>
 been told to me in confidence that he has written a paper
denouncing<br>
 all the clerks and officials, and full of facts about their
lives; in<br>
 short, the reason why his friends support him is because he
has<br>
 written this paper against the administration, in which we are
all<br>
 exposed--"</p>

<p>Phellion [in a loud voice]. "Monsieur Rabourdin is incapable
of--"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Very proper in you to say so. Tell me, Dutocq" [they
whisper<br>
 together and then go into the corridor].</p>

<p>Bixiou. "What has happened?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Do you remember what I said to you about that
caricature?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Yes, what then?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Make it, and you shall be under-head-clerk with a
famous fee.<br>
 The fact is, my dear fellow, there's dissension among the powers
that<br>
 be. The minister is pledged to Rabourdin, but if he doesn't
appoint<br>
 Baudoyer he offends the priests and their party. You see, the
King,<br>
 the Dauphin and the Dauphine, the clergy, and lastly the court,
all<br>
 want Baudoyer; the minister wants Rabourdin."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Good!"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "To ease the matter off, the minister, who sees he
must give<br>
 way, wants to strangle the difficulty. We must find some good
reason<br>
 for getting rid of Rabourdin. Now somebody has lately unearthed
a<br>
 paper of his, exposing the present system of administration
and<br>
 wanting to reform it; and that paper is going the rounds,--at
least,<br>
 this is how I understand the matter. Make the drawing we talked
of; in<br>
 so doing you'll play the game of all the big people, and help
the<br>
 minister, the court, the clergy,--in short, everybody; and
you'll get<br>
 your appointment. Now do you understand me?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "I don't understand how you came to know all that;
perhaps you<br>
 are inventing it."</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Do you want me to let you see what Rabourdin wrote
about<br>
 you?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Yes."</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Then come home with me; for I must put the document
into safe<br>
 keeping."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "You go first alone." [Re-enters the bureau
Rabourdin.] "What<br>
 Dutocq told you is really all true, word of honor! It seems
that<br>
 Monsieur Rabourdin has written and sent in very unflattering<br>
 descriptions of the clerks whom he wants to 'reform.' That's the
real<br>
 reason why his secret friends wish him appointed. Well, well; we
live<br>
 in days when nothing astonishes me" [flings his cloak about him
like<br>
 Talma, and declaims]:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Thou who has seen the fall of grand, illustrious heads,<br>
 Why thus amazed, insensate that thou art,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"to find a man like Rabourdin employing such means? Baudoyer
is too<br>
 much of a fool to know how to use them. Accept my
congratulations,<br>
 gentlemen; either way you are under a most illustrious chief"
[goes<br>
 off].</p>

<p><br>
 Poiret. "I shall leave this ministry without ever comprehending
a<br>
 single word that gentleman utters. What does he mean with his
'heads<br>
 that fall'?"</p>

<p>Fleury. "'Heads that fell?' why, think of the four sergeants
of<br>
 Rochelle, Ney, Berton, Caron, the brothers Faucher, and the<br>
 massacres."</p>

<p>Phellion. "He asserts very flippantly things that he only
guesses at."</p>

<p>Fleury. "Say at once that he lies; in his mouth truth itself
turns to<br>
 corrosion."</p>

<p>Phellion. "Your language is unparliamentary and lacks the
courtesy and<br>
 consideration which are due to a colleague."</p>

<p>Vimeux. "It seems to me that if what he says is false, the
proper name<br>
 for it is calumny, defamation of character; and such a
slanderer<br>
 deserves the thrashing."</p>

<p>Fleury [getting hot]. "If the government offices are public
places,<br>
 the matter ought to be taken into the police-courts."</p>

<p>Phellion [wishing to avert a quarrel, tries to turn the
conversation].<br>
 "Gentleman, might I ask you to keep quiet? I am writing a
little<br>
 treatise on moral philosophy, and I am just at the heart of
it."</p>

<p>Fleury [interrupting]. "What are you saying about it,
Monsieur<br>
 Phellion?"</p>

<p>Phellion [reading]. "Question.--What is the soul of man?</p>

<p>"Answer.--A spiritual substance which thinks and reasons."</p>

<p>Thuillier. "Spiritual substance! you might as well talk
about<br>
 immaterial stone."</p>

<p>Poiret. "Don't interrupt; let him go on."</p>

<p>Phellion [continuing]. "Quest.--Whence comes the soul?</p>

<p>"Ans.--From God, who created it of a nature one and
indivisible; the<br>
 destructibility thereof is, consequently, not conceivable, and
he hath<br>
 said--"</p>

<p>Poiret [amazed]. "God said?"</p>

<p>Phellion. "Yes, monsieur; tradition authorizes the
statement."</p>

<p>Fleury [to Poiret]. "Come, don't interrupt, yourself."</p>

<p>Phellion [resuming]. "--and he hath said that he created it
immortal;<br>
 in other words, the soul can never die.</p>

<p>"Quest.--What are the uses of the soul?</p>

<p>"Ans.--To comprehend, to will, to remember; these
constitute<br>
 understanding, volition, memory.</p>

<p>"Quest.--What are the uses of the understanding?</p>

<p>"Ans.--To know. It is the eye of the soul."</p>

<p>Fleury. "And the soul is the eye of what?"</p>

<p>Phellion [continuing]. "Quest.--What ought the understanding
to know?</p>

<p>"Ans.--Truth.</p>

<p>"Quest.--Why does man possess volition?</p>

<p>"Ans.--To love good and hate evil.</p>

<p>"Quest.--What is good?</p>

<p>"Ans.--That which makes us happy."</p>

<p>Vimeux. "Heavens! do you teach that to young ladies?"</p>

<p>Phellion. "Yes" [continuing]. "Quest.--How many kinds of good
are<br>
 there?"</p>

<p>Fleury. "Amazingly indecorous, to say the least."</p>

<p>Phellion [aggrieved]. "Oh, monsieur!" [Controlling himself.]
"But<br>
 here's the answer,--that's as far as I have got" [reads]:--</p>

<p>"Ans.--There are two kinds of good,--eternal good and temporal
good."</p>

<p>Poiret [with a look of contempt]. "And does that sell for
anything?"</p>

<p>Phellion. "I hope it will. It requires great application of
mind to<br>
 carry on a system of questions and answers; that is why I ask
you to<br>
 be quiet and let me think, for the answers--"</p>

<p>Thuillier [interrupting]. "The answers might be sold
separately."</p>

<p>Poiret. "Is that a pun?"</p>

<p>Thuillier. "No; a riddle."</p>

<p>Phellion. "I am sorry I interrupted you" [he dives into his
office<br>
 desk]. "But" [to himself] "at any rate, I have stopped their
talking<br>
 about Monsieur Rabourdin."</p>

<p>At this moment a scene was taking place between the minister
and des<br>
 Lupeaulx which decided Rabourdin's fate. The general-secretary
had<br>
 gone to see the minister in his private study before the
breakfast-<br>
 hour, to make sure that La Briere was not within hearing.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency is not treating me frankly--"</p>

<p>"He means a quarrel," thought the minister; "and all because
his<br>
 mistress coquetted with me last night. I did not think you
so<br>
 juvenile, my dear friend," he said aloud.</p>

<p>"Friend?" said the general-secretary, "that is what I want to
find<br>
 out."</p>

<p>The minister looked haughtily at des Lupeaulx.</p>

<p>"We are alone," continued the secretary, "and we can come to
an<br>
 understanding. The deputy of the arrondissement in which my
estate is<br>
 situated--"</p>

<p>"So it is really an estate!" said the minister, laughing, to
hide his<br>
 surprise.</p>

<p>"Increased by a recent purchase of two hundred thousand
francs' worth<br>
 of adjacent property," replied des Lupeaulx, carelessly. "You
knew of<br>
 the deputy's approaching resignation at least ten days ago, and
you<br>
 did not tell me of it. You were perhaps not bound to do so, but
you<br>
 knew very well that I am most anxious to take my seat in the
centre.<br>
 Has it occurred to you that I might fling myself back on the<br>
 'Doctrine'?--which, let me tell you, will destroy the
administration<br>
 and the monarchy both if you continue to allow the party of<br>
 representative government to be recruited from men of talent
whom you<br>
 ignore. Don't you know that in every nation there are fifty to
sixty,<br>
 not more, dangerous heads, whose schemes are in proportion to
their<br>
 ambition? The secret of knowing how to govern is to know those
heads<br>
 well, and either to chop them off or buy them. I don't know how
much<br>
 talent I have, but I know that I have ambition; and you are
committing<br>
 a serious blunder when you set aside a man who wishes you well.
The<br>
 anointed head dazzles for the time being, but what next?--Why, a
war<br>
 of words; discussions will spring up once more and grow
embittered,<br>
 envenomed. Then, for your own sake, I advise you not to find me
at the<br>
 Left Centre. In spite of your prefect's manoeuvres (instructions
for<br>
 which no doubt went from here confidentially) I am secure of
a<br>
 majority. The time has come for you and me to understand each
other.<br>
 After a breeze like this people sometimes become closer friends
than<br>
 ever. I must be made count and receive the grand cordon of the
Legion<br>
 of honor as a reward for my public services. However, I care
less for<br>
 those things just now than I do for something else in which you
are<br>
 more personally concerned. You have not yet appointed Rabourdin,
and I<br>
 have news this morning which tends to show that most persons
will be<br>
 better satisfied if you appoint Baudoyer."</p>

<p>"Appoint Baudoyer!" echoed the minister. "Do you know
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said des Lupeaulx; "but suppose he proves incapable, as
he<br>
 will, you can then get rid of him by asking those who protect
him to<br>
 employ him elsewhere. You will thus get back an important office
to<br>
 give to friends; it may come in at the right moment to
facilitate some<br>
 compromise."</p>

<p>"But I have pledged it to Rabourdin."</p>

<p>"That may be; and I don't ask you to make the change this very
day. I<br>
 know the danger of saying yes and no within twenty-four hours.
But<br>
 postpone the appointment, and don't sign the papers till the day
after<br>
 to-morrow; by that time you may find it impossible to retain<br>
 Rabourdin,--in fact, in all probability, he will send you
his<br>
 resignation--"</p>

<p>"His resignation?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He is the tool of a secret power in whose interests he has
carried on<br>
 a system of espionage in all the ministries, and the thing has
been<br>
 discovered by mere accident. He has written a paper of some
kind,<br>
 giving short histories of all the officials. Everybody is
talking of<br>
 it; the clerks are furious. For heaven's sake, don't transact
business<br>
 with him to-day; let me find some means for you to avoid it. Ask
an<br>
 audience of the King; I am sure you will find great satisfaction
there<br>
 if you concede the point about Baudoyer; and you can obtain
something<br>
 as an equivalent. Your position will be better than ever if you
are<br>
 forced later to dismiss a fool whom the court party impose upon
you."</p>

<p>"What has made you turn against Rabourdin?"</p>

<p>"Would you forgive Monsieur de Chateaubriand for writing an
article<br>
 against the ministry? Well, read that, and see how Rabourdin
has<br>
 treated me in his secret document," said des Lupeaulx, giving
the<br>
 paper to the minister. "He pretends to reorganize the government
from<br>
 beginning to end,--no doubt in the interests of some secret
society of<br>
 which, as yet, we know nothing. I shall continue to be his
friend for<br>
 the sake of watching him; by that means I may render the
government<br>
 such signal service that they will have to make me count; for
the<br>
 peerage is the only thing I really care for. I want you fully
to<br>
 understand that I am not seeking office or anything else that
would<br>
 cause me to stand in your way; I am simply aiming for the
peerage,<br>
 which will enable me to marry a banker's daughter with an income
of a<br>
 couple of hundred thousand francs. And so, allow me to render
you a<br>
 few signal services which will make the King feel that I have
saved<br>
 the throne. I have long said that Liberalism would never offer
us a<br>
 pitched battle. It has given up conspiracies, Carbonaroism,
and<br>
 revolts with weapons; it is now sapping and mining, and the day
is<br>
 coming when it will be able to say, 'Out of that and let me in!'
Do<br>
 you think I have been courting Rabourdin's wife for my own
pleasure?<br>
 No, but I got much information from her. So now, let us agree on
two<br>
 things; first, the postponement of the appointment; second,
your<br>
 SINCERE support of my election. You shall find at the end of
the<br>
 session that I have amply repaid you."</p>

<p>For all answer, the minister took the appointment papers and
placed<br>
 them in des Lupeaulx's hand.</p>

<p>"I will go and tell Rabourdin," added des Lupeaulx, "that you
cannot<br>
 transact business with him till Saturday."</p>

<p>The minister replied with an assenting gesture. The
secretary<br>
 despatched his man with a message to Rabourdin that the minister
could<br>
 not work with him until Saturday, on which day the Chamber
was<br>
 occupied with private bills, and his Excellency had more time at
his<br>
 disposal.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Saillard, having brought the monthly
stipend, was<br>
 slipping his little speech into the ear of the minister's wife,
who<br>
 drew herself up and answered with dignity that she did not
meddle in<br>
 political matters, and besides, she had heard that Monsieur
Rabourdin<br>
 was already appointed. Saillard, terrified, rushed up to
Baudoyer's<br>
 office, where he found Dutocq, Godard, and Bixiou in a state
of<br>
 exasperation difficult to describe; for they were reading the
terrible<br>
 paper on the administration in which they were all
discussed.</p>

<p>Bixiou [with his finger on a paragraph]. "Here YOU are, pere
Saillard.<br>
 Listen" [reads]:--</p>

<p>"Saillard.--The office of cashier to be suppressed in all
the<br>
 ministries; their accounts to be kept in future at the
Treasury.<br>
 Saillard is rich and does not need a pension.</p>

<p>"Do you want to hear about your son-in-law?" [Turns over the
leaves.]<br>
 "Here he is" [reads]:--</p>

<p>"Baudoyer.--Utterly incapable. To be thanked and dismissed.
Rich; does<br>
 not need a pension.</p>

<p>"And here's for Godard" [reads]:--</p>

<p>"Godard.--Should be dismissed; pension one-third of his
present<br>
 salary.</p>

<p>"In short, here we all are. Listen to what I am" [reads]: "An
artist<br>
 who might be employed by the civil list, at the Opera, or the
Menus-<br>
 Plaisirs, or the Museum. Great deal of capacity, little
self-respect,<br>
 no application,--a restless spirit. Ha! I'll give you a touch of
the<br>
 artist, Monsieur Rabourdin!"</p>

<p>Saillard. "Suppress cashiers! Why, the man's a monster?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Let us see what he says of our mysterious Desroys."
[Turns<br>
 over the pages; reads.]</p>

<p>"Desroys.--Dangerous; because he cannot be shaken in
principles that<br>
 are subversive of monarchial power. He is the son of the
Conventionel,<br>
 and he admires the Convention. He may become a very
mischievous<br>
 journalist."</p>

<p>Baudoyer. "The police are not worse spies!"</p>

<p>Godard. "I shall go the general-secretary and lay a complaint
in form;<br>
 we must all resign in a body if such a man as that is put over
us."</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Gentlemen, listen to me; let us be prudent. If you
rise at<br>
 once in a body, we may all be accused of rancor and revenge. No,
let<br>
 the thing work, let the rumor spread quietly. When the whole
ministry<br>
 is aroused your remonstrances will meet with general
approval."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Dutocq believes in the principles of the grand air
composed<br>
 by the sublime Rossini for Basilio,--which goes to show, by the
bye,<br>
 that the great composer was also a great politician. I shall
leave my<br>
 card on Monsieur Rabourdin to-morrow morning, inscribed thus:
'Bixiou;<br>
 no self-respect, no application, restless mind.'"</p>

<p>Godard. "A good idea, gentlemen. Let us all leave our cards
to-morrow<br>
 on Rabourdin inscribed in the same way."</p>

<p>Dutocq [leading Bixiou apart]. "Come, you'll agree to make
that<br>
 caricature now, won't you?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "I see plainly, my dear fellow, that you knew all
about this<br>
 affair ten days ago" [looks him in the eye]. "Am I to be
under-head-<br>
 clerk?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "On my word of honor, yes, and a thousand-franc fee
beside,<br>
 just as I told you. You don't know what a service you'll be
rendering<br>
 to powerful personages."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "You know them?"</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Yes."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Well, then I want to speak with them."</p>

<p>Dutocq [dryly]. "You can make the caricature or not, and you
can be<br>
 under-head-clerk or not,--as you please."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "At any rate, let me see that thousand francs."</p>

<p>Dutocq. "You shall have them when you bring the drawing."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Forward, march! that lampoon shall go from end to end
of the<br>
 bureaus to-morrow morning. Let us go and torment the
Rabourdins."<br>
 [Then speaking to Saillard, Godard, and Baudoyer, who were
talking<br>
 together in a low voice.] "We are going to stir up the
neighbors."<br>
 [Goes with Dutocq into the Rabourdin bureau. Fleury, Thuillier,
and<br>
 Vimeux are there, talking excitedly.] "What's the matter,
gentlemen?<br>
 All that I told you turns out to be true; you can go and see
for<br>
 yourselves the work of this infamous informer; for it is in the
hands<br>
 of the virtuous, honest, estimable, upright, and pious Baudoyer,
who<br>
 is indeed utterly incapable of doing any such thing. Your chief
has<br>
 got every one of you under the guillotine. Go and see; follow
the<br>
 crowd; money returned if you are not satisfied; execution
GRATIS! The<br>
 appointments are postponed. All the bureaus are in arms;
Rabourdin has<br>
 been informed that the minister will not work with him. Come, be
off;<br>
 go and see for yourselves."</p>

<p><br>
 They all depart except Phellion and Poiret, who are left alone.
The<br>
 former loved Rabourdin too well to look for proof that might
injure a<br>
 man he was determined not to judge; the other had only five days
more<br>
 to remain in the office, and cared nothing either way. Just
then<br>
 Sebastien came down to collect the papers for signature. He was
a good<br>
 deal surprised, though he did not show it, to find the
office<br>
 deserted.</p>

<p>Phellion. "My young friend" [he rose, a rare thing], "do you
know what<br>
 is going on? what scandals are rife about Monsieur Rabourdin
whom you<br>
 love, and" [bending to whisper in Sebastien's ear] "whom I love
as<br>
 much as I respect him. They say he has committed the imprudence
to<br>
 leave a paper containing comments on the officials lying about
in the<br>
 office--" [Phellion stopped short, caught the young man in his
strong<br>
 arms, seeing that he turned pale and was near fainting, and
placed him<br>
 on a chair.] "A key, Monsieur Poiret, to put down his back; have
you a<br>
 key?"</p>

<p>Poiret. "I have the key of my domicile."</p>

<p>[Old Poiret junior promptly inserted the said key between
Sebastien's<br>
 shoulders, while Phellion gave him some water to drink. The poor
lad<br>
 no sooner opened his eyes than he began to weep. He laid his
head on<br>
 Phellion's desk, and all his limbs were limp as if struck by<br>
 lightning; while his sobs were so heartrending, so genuine, that
for<br>
 the first time in his life Poiret's feelings were stirred by
the<br>
 sufferings of another.]</p>

<p>Phellion [speaking firmly]. "Come, come, my young friend;
courage! In<br>
 times of trial we must show courage. You are a man. What is
the<br>
 matter? What has happened to distress you so terribly?"</p>

<p>Sebastien [sobbing]. "It is I who have ruined Monsieur
Rabourdin. I<br>
 left that paper lying about when I copied it. I have killed
my<br>
 benefactor; I shall die myself. Such a noble man!--a man who
ought to<br>
 be minister!"</p>

<p>Poiret [blowing his nose]. "Then it is true he wrote the
report."</p>

<p>Sebastien [still sobbing]. "But it was to--there, I was going
to tell<br>
 his secrets! Ah! that wretch of a Dutocq; it was he who stole
the<br>
 paper."</p>

<p>His tears and sobs recommenced and made so much noise that
Rabourdin<br>
 came up to see what was the matter. He found the young fellow
almost<br>
 fainting in the arms of Poiret and Phellion.</p>

<p>Rabourdin. "What is the matter, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>Sebastien [struggling to his feet, and then falling on his
knees<br>
 before Rabourdin]. "I have ruined you, monsieur. That
memorandum,--<br>
 Dutocq, the monster, he must have taken it."</p>

<p>Rabourdin [calmly]. "I knew that already" [he lifts
Sebastien]. "You<br>
 are a child, my young friend." [Speaks to Phellion.] "Where are
the<br>
 other gentlemen?"</p>

<p>Phellion. "They have gone into Monsieur Baudoyer's office to
see a<br>
 paper which it is said--"</p>

<p>Rabourdin [interrupting him]. "Enough." [Goes out, taking
Sebastien<br>
 with him. Poiret and Phellion look at each other in amazement,
and do<br>
 not know what to say.]</p>

<p>Poiret [to Phellion]. "Monsieur Rabourdin--"</p>

<p>Phellion [to Poiret]. "Monsieur Rabourdin--"</p>

<p>Poiret. "Well, I never! Monsieur Rabourdin!"</p>

<p>Phellion. "But did you notice how calm and dignified he
was?"</p>

<p>Poiret [with a sly look that was more like a grimace]. "I
shouldn't be<br>
 surprised if there were something under it all."</p>

<p>Phellion. "A man of honor; pure and spotless."</p>

<p>Poiret. "Who is?"</p>

<p>Phellion. "Monsieur Poiret, you think as I think about Dutocq;
surely<br>
 you understand me?"</p>

<p>Poiret [nodding his head three times and answering with a
shrewd<br>
 look]. "Yes." [The other clerks return.]</p>

<p>Fleury. "A great shock; I still don't believe the thing.
Monsieur<br>
 Rabourdin, a king among men! If such men are spies, it is enough
to<br>
 disgust one with virtue. I have always put Rabourdin among
Plutarch's<br>
 heroes."</p>

<p>Vimeux. "It is all true."</p>

<p>Poiret [reflecting that he had only five days more to stay in
the<br>
 office]. "But, gentlemen, what do you say about the man who
stole that<br>
 paper, who spied upon Rabourdin?" [Dutocq left the room.]</p>

<p>Fleury. "I say he is a Judas Iscariot. Who is he?"</p>

<p>Phellion [significantly]. "He is not here at THIS MOMENT."</p>

<p>Vimeux [enlightened]. "It is Dutocq!"</p>

<p>Phellion. "I have no proof of it, gentlemen. While you were
gone, that<br>
 young man, Monsieur de la Roche, nearly fainted here. See his
tears on<br>
 my desk!"</p>

<p>Poiret. "We held him fainting in our arms.--My key, the key of
my<br>
 domicile!--dear, dear! it is down his back." [Poiret goes
hastily<br>
 out.]</p>

<p>Vimeux. "The minister refused to transact business with
Rabourdin to-<br>
 day; and Monsieur Saillard, to whom the secretary said a few
words,<br>
 came to tell Monsieur Baudoyer to apply for the cross of the
Legion of<br>
 honor,--there is one to be granted, you know, on New-Year's day,
to<br>
 all the heads of divisions. It is quite clear what it all
means.<br>
 Monsieur Rabourdin is sacrificed by the very persons who
employed him.<br>
 Bixiou says so. We were all to be turned out, except Sebastien
and<br>
 Phellion."</p>

<p>Du Bruel [entering]. "Well, gentlemen, is it true?"</p>

<p>Thuillier. "To the last word."</p>

<p>Du Bruel [putting his hat on again]. "Good-bye." [Hurries
out.]</p>

<p>Thuillier. "He may rush as much as he pleases to his Duc de
Rhetore<br>
 and Duc de Maufrigneuse, but Colleville is to be our
under-head-clerk,<br>
 that's certain."</p>

<p>Phellion. "Du Bruel always seemed to be attached to
Monsieur<br>
 Rabourdin."</p>

<p>Poiret [returning]. "I have had a world of trouble to get back
my key.<br>
 That boy is crying still, and Monsieur Rabourdin has
disappeared."<br>
 [Dutocq and Bixiou enter.]</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Ha, gentlemen! strange things are going on in your
bureau. Du<br>
 Bruel! I want you." [Looks into the adjoining room.] "Gone?"</p>

<p>Thuillier. "Full speed."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "What about Rabourdin?"</p>

<p>Fleury. "Distilled, evaporated, melted! Such a man, the king
of men,<br>
 that he--"</p>

<p>Poiret [to Dutocq]. "That little Sebastien, in his trouble,
said that<br>
 you, Monsieur Dutocq, had taken the paper from him ten days
ago."</p>

<p>Bixiou [looking at Dutocq]. "You must clear yourself of THAT,
my good<br>
 friend." [All the clerks look fixedly at Dutocq.]</p>

<p>Dutocq. "Where's the little viper who copied it?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Copied it? How did you know he copied it? Ha! ha! it
is only<br>
 the diamond that cuts the diamond." [Dutocq leaves the
room.]</p>

<p>Poiret. "Would you listen to me, Monsieur Bixiou? I have only
five<br>
 days and a half to stay in this office, and I do wish that once,
only<br>
 once, I might have the pleasure of understanding what you mean.
Do me<br>
 the honor to explain what diamonds have to do with these
present<br>
 circumstances."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "I meant papa,--for I'm willing for once to bring my
intellect<br>
 down to the level of yours,--that just as the diamond alone can
cut<br>
 the diamond, so it is only one inquisitive man who can defeat
another<br>
 inquisitive man."</p>

<p>Fleury. "'Inquisitive man' stands for 'spy.'"</p>

<p>Poiret. "I don't understand."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Very well; try again some other time."</p>

<p>Monsieur Rabourdin, after taking Sebastien to his room, had
gone<br>
 straight to the minister; but the minister was at the Chamber
of<br>
 Deputies. Rabourdin went at once to the Chamber, where he wrote
a note<br>
 to his Excellency, who was at that moment in the tribune engaged
in a<br>
 hot discussion. Rabourdin waited, not in the conference hall,
but in<br>
 the courtyard, where, in spite of the cold, he resolved to
remain and<br>
 intercept his Excellency as he got into his carriage. The usher
of the<br>
 Chamber had told him that the minister was in the thick of a<br>
 controversy raised by the nineteen members of the extreme Left,
and<br>
 that the session was likely to be stormy. Rabourdin walked to
and for<br>
 in the courtyard of the palace for five mortal hours, a prey
to<br>
 feverish agitation. At half-past six o'clock the session broke
up, and<br>
 the members filed out. The minister's chasseur came up to find
the<br>
 coachman.</p>

<p>"Hi, Jean!" he called out to him; "Monseigneur has gone with
the<br>
 minister of war; they are going to see the King, and after that
they<br>
 dine together, and we are to fetch him at ten o'clock. There's
a<br>
 Council this evening."</p>

<p>Rabourdin walked slowly home, in a state of despondency not
difficult<br>
 to imagine. It was seven o'clock, and he had barely time to
dress.</p>

<p>"Well, you are appointed?" cried his wife, joyously, as he
entered the<br>
 salon.</p>

<p>Rabourdin raised his head with a grievous motion of distress
and<br>
 answered, "I fear I shall never again set foot in the
ministry."</p>

<p>"What?" said his wife, quivering with sudden anxiety.</p>

<p>"My memorandum on the officials is known in all the offices;
and I<br>
 have not been able to see the minister."</p>

<p>Celestine's eyes were opened to a sudden vision in which the
devil, in<br>
 one of his infernal flashes, showed her the meaning of her
last<br>
 conversation with des Lupeaulx.</p>

<p>"If I had behaved like a low woman," she thought, "we should
have had<br>
 the place."</p>

<p>She looked at Rabourdin with grief in her heart. A sad silence
fell<br>
 between them, and dinner was eaten in the midst of gloomy
meditations.</p>

<p>"And it is my Wednesday," she said at last.</p>

<p>"All is not lost, dear Celestine," said Rabourdin, laying a
kiss on<br>
 his wife's forehead; "perhaps to-morrow I shall be able to see
the<br>
 minister and explain everything. Sebastien sat up all last night
to<br>
 finish the writing; the papers are copied and collated; I shall
place<br>
 them on the minister's desk and beg him to read them through.
La<br>
 Briere will help me. A man is never condemned without a
hearing."</p>

<p>"I am curious to see if Monsieur des Lupeaulx will come here
to-<br>
 night."</p>

<p>"He? Of course he will come," said Rabourdin; "there's
something of<br>
 the tiger in him; he likes to lick the blood of the wounds he
has<br>
 given."</p>

<p>"My poor husband," said his wife, taking his hand, "I don't
see how it<br>
 is that a man who could conceive so noble a reform did not also
see<br>
 that it ought not to be communicated to a single person. It is
one of<br>
 those ideas that a man should keep in his own mind, for he alone
can<br>
 apply them. A statesman must do in our political sphere as
Napoleon<br>
 did in his; he stooped, twisted, crawled. Yes, Bonaparte
crawled! To<br>
 be made commander-in-chief of the Army of Italy he married
Barrere's<br>
 mistress. You should have waited, got yourself elected
deputy,<br>
 followed the politics of a party, sometimes down in the depths,
at<br>
 other times on the crest of the wave, and you should have taken,
like<br>
 Monsieur de Villele, the Italian motto 'Col tempo,' in other
words,<br>
 'All things are given to him who knows how to wait.' That great
orator<br>
 worked for seven years to get into power; he began in 1814
by<br>
 protesting against the Charter when he was the same age that you
are<br>
 now. Here's your fault; you have allowed yourself to be kept<br>
 subordinate, when you were born to rule."</p>

<p>The entrance of the painter Schinner imposed silence on the
wife and<br>
 husband, but these words made the latter thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Dear friend," said the painter, grasping Rabourdin's hand,
"the<br>
 support of artists is a useless thing enough, but let me say
under<br>
 these circumstances that we are all faithful to you. I have just
read<br>
 the evening papers. Baudoyer is appointed director and receives
the<br>
 cross of the Legion of honor--"</p>

<p>"I have been longer in the department, I have served
twenty-four<br>
 hours," said Rabourdin with a smile.</p>

<p>"I know Monsieur le Comte de Serizy, the minister of State,
pretty<br>
 well, and if he can help you, I will go and see him," said
Schinner.</p>

<p>The salon soon filled with persons who knew nothing of the
government<br>
 proceedings. Du Bruel did not appear. Madame Rabourdin was gayer
and<br>
 more graceful than ever, like the charger wounded in battle,
that<br>
 still finds strength to carry his master from the field.</p>

<p>"She is very courageous," said a few women who knew the truth,
and who<br>
 were charmingly attentive to her, understanding her
misfortunes.</p>

<p>"But she certainly did a great deal to attract des Lupeaulx,"
said the<br>
 Baronne du Chatelet to the Vicomtesse de Fontaine.</p>

<p>"Do you think--" began the vicomtesse.</p>

<p>"If so," interrupted Madame de Camps, in defence of her
friend,<br>
 "Monsieur Rabourdin would at least have had the cross."</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock des Lupeaulx appeared; and we can only
describe<br>
 him by saying that his spectacles were sad and his eyes joyous;
the<br>
 glasses, however, obscured the glances so successfully that only
a<br>
 physiognomist would have seen the diabolical expression which
they<br>
 wore. He went up to Rabourdin and pressed the hand which the
latter<br>
 could not avoid giving him.</p>

<p>Then he approached Madame Rabourdin.</p>

<p>"We have much to say to each other," he remarked as he seated
himself<br>
 beside the beautiful woman, who received him admirably.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he continued, giving her a side glance, "you are grand
indeed; I<br>
 find you just what I expected, glorious under defeat. Do you
know that<br>
 it is a very rare thing to find a superior woman who answers to
the<br>
 expectations formed of her. So defeat doesn't dishearten you?
You are<br>
 right; we shall triumph in the end," he whispered in her ear.
"Your<br>
 fate is always in your own hands,--so long, I mean, as your ally
is a<br>
 man who adores you. We will hold counsel together."</p>

<p><br>
 "But is Baudoyer appointed?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the secretary.</p>

<p>"Does he get the cross?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; but he will have it later."</p>

<p>"Amazing!"</p>

<p>"Ah! you don't understand political exigencies."</p>

<p>During this evening, which seemed interminable to Madame
Rabourdin,<br>
 another scene was occurring in the place Royale,--one of
those<br>
 comedies which are played in seven Parisian salons whenever
there is a<br>
 change of ministry. The Saillards' salon was crowded. Monsieur
and<br>
 Madame Transon arrived at eight o'clock; Madame Transon kissed
Madame<br>
 Baudoyer, nee Saillard. Monsieur Bataille, captain of the
National<br>
 Guard, came with his wife and the curate of Saint Paul's.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Baudoyer," said Madame Transon. "I wish to be the
first to<br>
 congratulate you; they have done justice to your talents. You
have<br>
 indeed earned your promotion."</p>

<p>"Here you are, director," said Monsieur Transon, rubbing his
hands,<br>
 "and the appointment is very flattering to this
neighborhood."</p>

<p>"And we can truly say it came to pass without any intriguing,"
said<br>
 the worthy Saillard. "We are none of us political intriguers; WE
don't<br>
 go to select parties at the ministry."</p>

<p>Uncle Mitral rubbed his nose and grinned as he glanced at his
niece<br>
 Elisabeth, the woman whose hand had pulled the wires, who was
talking<br>
 with Gigonnet. Falleix, honest fellow, did not know what to make
of<br>
 the stupid blindness of Saillard and Baudoyer. Messieurs
Dutocq,<br>
 Bixiou, du Bruel, Godard, and Colleville (the latter appointed
head of<br>
 the bureau) entered.</p>

<p>"What a crew!" whispered Bixiou to du Bruel. "I could make a
fine<br>
 caricature of them in the shapes of fishes,--dorys, flounders,
sharks,<br>
 and snappers, all dancing a saraband!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said Colleville, "I come to offer you my
congratulations;<br>
 or rather we congratulate ourselves in having such a man placed
over<br>
 us; and we desire to assure you of the zeal with which we shall
co-<br>
 operate in your labors. Allow me to say that this event affords
a<br>
 signal proof to the truth of my axiom that a man's destiny lies
in the<br>
 letters of his name. I may say that I knew of this appointment
and of<br>
 your other honors before I heard of them, for I spend the night
in<br>
 anagrammatizing your name as follows:" [proudly] "Isidore C.
T.<br>
 Baudoyer,--Director, decorated by us (his Majesty the King,
of<br>
 course)."</p>

<p>Baudoyer bowed and remarked piously that names were given in
baptism.</p>

<p>Monsieur and Madame Baudoyer, senior, father and mother of the
new<br>
 director, were there to enjoy the glory of their son and
daughter-in-<br>
 law. Uncle Gigonnet-Bidault, who had dined at the house, had
a<br>
 restless, fidgety look in his eye which frightened Bixiou.</p>

<p>"There's a queer one," said the latter to du Bruel, calling
his<br>
 attention to Gigonnet, "who would do in a vaudeville. I wonder
if he<br>
 could be bought. Such an old scarecrow is just the thing for a
sign<br>
 over the Two Baboons. And what a coat! I did think there was
nobody<br>
 but Poiret who could show the like after that after ten years'
public<br>
 exposure to the inclemencies of Parisian weather."</p>

<p>"Baudoyer is magnificent," said du Bruel.</p>

<p>"Dazzling," answered Bixiou.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Baudoyer, "let me present you to my own
uncle,<br>
 Monsieur Mitral, and to my great-uncle through my wife,
Monsieur<br>
 Bidault."</p>

<p>Gigonnet and Mitral gave a glance at the three clerks so
penetrating,<br>
 so glittering with gleams of gold, that the two scoffers were
sobered<br>
 at once.</p>

<p>"Hein?" said Bixiou, when they were safely under the arcades
in the<br>
 place Royale; "did you examine those uncles?--two copies of
Shylock.<br>
 I'll bet their money is lent in the market at a hundred per cent
per<br>
 week. They lend on pawn; and sell most that they lay hold of,
coats,<br>
 gold lace, cheese, men, women, and children; they are a
conglomeration<br>
 of Arabs, Jews, Genoese, Genevese, Greeks, Lombards, and
Parisians,<br>
 suckled by a wolf and born of a Turkish woman."</p>

<p>"I believe you," said Godard. "Uncle Mitral used to be a
sheriff's<br>
 officer."</p>

<p>"That settles it," said du Bruel.</p>

<p>"I'm off to see the proof of my caricature," said Bixiou; "but
I<br>
 should like to study the state of things in Rabourdin's salon
to-<br>
 night. You are lucky to be able to go there, du Bruel."</p>

<p>"I!" said the vaudevillist, "what should I do there? My face
doesn't<br>
 lend itself to condolences. And it is very vulgar in these days
to go<br>
 and see people who are down."</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h4>THE RESIGNATION</h4>

<p>By midnight Madame Rabourdin's salon was deserted; only two or
three<br>
 guests remained with des Lupeaulx and the master and mistress of
the<br>
 house. When Schinner and Monsieur and Madame de Camps had
likewise<br>
 departed, des Lupeaulx rose with a mysterious air, stood with
his back<br>
 to the fireplace and looked alternately at the husband and
wife.</p>

<p>"My friends," he said, "nothing is really lost, for the
minister and I<br>
 are faithful to you. Dutocq simply chose between two powers the
one he<br>
 thought strongest. He has served the court and the Grand
Almoner; he<br>
 has betrayed me. But that is in the order of things; a
politician<br>
 never complains of treachery. Nevertheless, Baudoyer will be
dismissed<br>
 as incapable in a few months; no doubt his protectors will find
him a<br>
 place,--in the prefecture of police, perhaps,--for the clergy
will not<br>
 desert him."</p>

<p><br>
 From this point des Lupeaulx went on with a long tirade about
the<br>
 Grand Almoner and the dangers the government ran in relying upon
the<br>
 church and upon the Jesuits. We need not, we think, point out to
the<br>
 intelligent reader that the court and the Grand Almoner, to whom
the<br>
 liberal journals attributed an enormous influence under the<br>
 administration, had little really to do with Monsieur
Baudoyer's<br>
 appointment. Such petty intrigues die in the upper sphere of
great<br>
 self-interests. If a few words in favor of Baudoyer were
obtained by<br>
 the importunity of the curate of Saint-Paul's and the Abbe
Gaudron,<br>
 they would have been withdrawn immediately at a suggestion from
the<br>
 minister. The occult power of the Congregation of Jesus
(admissible<br>
 certainly as confronting the bold society of the "Doctrine,"
entitled<br>
 "Help yourself and heaven will help you,") was formidable only
through<br>
 the imaginary force conferred on it by subordinate powers
who<br>
 perpetually threatened each other with its evils. The liberal
scandal-<br>
 mongers delighted in representing the Grand Almoner and the
whole<br>
 Jesuitical Chapter as political, administrative, civil, and
military<br>
 giants. Fear creates bugbears. At this crisis Baudoyer firmly
believed<br>
 in the said Chapter, little aware that the only Jesuits who had
put<br>
 him where he now was sat by his own fireside, and in the Cafe
Themis<br>
 playing dominoes.</p>

<p>At certain epochs in history certain powers appear, to whom
all evils<br>
 are attributed, though at the same time their genius is denied;
they<br>
 form an efficient argument in the mouth of fools. Just as
Monsieur de<br>
 Talleyrand was supposed to hail all events of whatever kind with
a bon<br>
 mot, so in these days of the Restoration the clerical party had
the<br>
 credit of doing and undoing everything. Unfortunately, it did
and<br>
 undid nothing. Its influence was not wielded by a Cardinal
Richelieu<br>
 or a Cardinal Mazarin; it was in the hands of a species of
Cardinal de<br>
 Fleury, who, timid for over five years, turned bold for one
day,<br>
 injudiciously bold. Later on, the "Doctrine" did more, with
impunity,<br>
 at Saint-Merri, than Charles X. pretended to do in July, 1830.
If the<br>
 section on the censorship so foolishly introduced into the new
charter<br>
 had been omitted, journalism also would have had its
Saint-Merri. The<br>
 younger Branch could have legally carried out Charles X.'s
plan.</p>

<p>"Remain where you are, head of a bureau under Baudoyer," went
on des<br>
 Lupeaulx. "Have the nerve to do this; make yourself a true
politician;<br>
 put ideas and generous impulses aside; attend only to your
functions;<br>
 don't say a word to your new director; don't help him with a<br>
 suggestion; and do nothing yourself without his order. In three
months<br>
 Baudoyer will be out of the ministry, either dismissed, or
stranded on<br>
 some other administrative shore. They may attach him to the
king's<br>
 household. Twice in my life I have been set aside as you are,
and<br>
 overwhelmed by an avalanche of folly; I have quietly waited and
let it<br>
 pass."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rabourdin, "but you were not calumniated; your
honor was<br>
 not assailed, compromised--"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" cried des Lupeaulx, interrupting him with a
burst of<br>
 Homeric laughter. "Why, that's the daily bread of every
remarkable man<br>
 in this glorious kingdom of France! And there are but two ways
to meet<br>
 such calumny,--either yield to it, pack up, and go plant
cabbages in<br>
 the country; or else rise above it, march on, fearless, and
don't turn<br>
 your head."</p>

<p>"For me, there is but one way of untying the noose which
treachery and<br>
 the work of spies have fastened round my throat," replied
Rabourdin.<br>
 "I must explain the matter at once to his Excellency, and if you
are<br>
 as sincerely attached to me as you say you are, you will put me
face<br>
 to face with him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You mean that you wish to explain to him your plan for the
reform of<br>
 the service?"</p>

<p>Rabourdin bowed.</p>

<p>"Well, then, trust the papers with me,--your memoranda, all
the<br>
 documents. I promise you that he shall sit up all night and
examine<br>
 them."</p>

<p>"Let us go to him, then!" cried Rabourdin, eagerly; "six
years' toil<br>
 certainly deserves two or three hours attention from the
king's<br>
 minister, who will be forced to recognize, if he does not
applaud,<br>
 such perseverance."</p>

<p>Compelled by Rabourdin's tenacity to take a straightforward
path,<br>
 without ambush or angle where his treachery could hide itself,
des<br>
 Lupeaulx hesitated for a single instant, and looked at
Madame<br>
 Rabourdin, while he inwardly asked himself, "Which shall I
permit to<br>
 triumph, my hatred for him, or my fancy for her?"</p>

<p>"You have no confidence in my honor," he said, after a pause.
"I see<br>
 that you will always be to me the author of your SECRET
ANALYSIS.<br>
 Adieu, madame."</p>

<p>Madame Rabourdin bowed coldly. Celestine and Xavier returned
at once<br>
 to their own rooms without a word; both were overcome by
their<br>
 misfortune. The wife thought of the dreadful situation in which
she<br>
 stood toward her husband. The husband, resolving slowly not to
remain<br>
 at the ministry but to send in his resignation at once, was lost
in a<br>
 sea of reflections; the crisis for him meant a total change of
life<br>
 and the necessity of starting on a new career. All night he sat
before<br>
 his fire, taking no notice of Celestine, who came in several
times on<br>
 tiptoe, in her night-dress.</p>

<p>"I must go once more to the ministry, to bring away my papers,
and<br>
 show Baudoyer the routine of the business," he said to himself
at<br>
 last. "I had better write my resignation now."</p>

<p>He turned to his table and began to write, thinking over each
clause<br>
 of the letter, which was as follows:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monseigneur,--I have the honor to inclose to your Excellency
my<br>
 resignation. I venture to hope that you still remember hearing
me<br>
 say that I left my honor in your hands, and that everything,
for<br>
 me, depended on my being able to give you an immediate<br>
 explanation.</p>

<p>This explanation I have vainly sought to give. To-day it
would,<br>
 perhaps, be useless; for a fragment of my work relating to
the<br>
 administration, stolen and misused, has gone the rounds of
the<br>
 offices and is misinterpreted by hatred; in consequence, I
find<br>
 myself compelled to resign, under the tacit condemnation of
my<br>
 superiors.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br>
 Your Excellency may have thought, on the morning when I
first<br>
 sought to speak with you, that my purpose was to ask for my<br>
 promotion, when, in fact, I was thinking only of the glory
and<br>
 usefulness of your ministry and of the public good. It is
all-<br>
 important, I think, to correct that impression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then followed the usual epistolary formulas.</p>

<p><br>
 It was half-past seven in the morning when the man consummated
the<br>
 sacrifice of his ideas; he burned everything, the toil of
years.<br>
 Fatigued by the pressure of thought, overcome by mental
suffering, he<br>
 fell asleep with his head on the back of his armchair. He was
wakened<br>
 by a curious sensation, and found his hands covered with his
wife's<br>
 tears and saw her kneeling before him. Celestine had read
the<br>
 resignation. She could measure the depth of his fall. They were
now to<br>
 be reduced to live on four thousand francs a year; and that day
she<br>
 had counted up her debts,--they amounted to something like
thirty-two<br>
 thousand francs! The most ignoble of all wretchedness had come
upon<br>
 them. And that noble man who had trusted her was ignorant that
she had<br>
 abused the fortune he had confided to her care. She was sobbing
at his<br>
 feet, beautiful as the Magdalen.</p>

<p>"My cup is full," cried Xavier, in terror. "I am dishonored at
the<br>
 ministry, and dishonored--"</p>

<p>The light of her pure honor flashed from Celestine's eyes; she
sprang<br>
 up like a startled horse and cast a fulminating glance at
Rabourdin.</p>

<p>"I! I!" she said, on two sublime tones. "Am I a base wife? If
I were,<br>
 you would have been appointed. But," she added mournfully, "it
is<br>
 easier to believe that than to believe what is the truth."</p>

<p>"Then what is it?" said Rabourdin.</p>

<p>"All in three words," she said; "I owe thirty thousand
francs."</p>

<p>Rabourdin caught his wife to his heart with a gesture of
almost<br>
 frantic joy, and seated her on his knee.</p>

<p>"Take comfort, dear," he said, in a tone of voice so adorably
kind<br>
 that the bitterness of her grief was changed to something<br>
 inexpressibly tender. "I too have made mistakes; I have
worked<br>
 uselessly for my country when I thought I was being useful to
her. But<br>
 now I mean to take another path. If I had sold groceries we
should now<br>
 be millionaires. Well, let us be grocers. You are only
twenty-eight,<br>
 dear angel; in ten years you shall recover the luxury that you
love,<br>
 which we must needs renounce for a short time. I, too, dear
heart, am<br>
 not a base or common husband. We will sell our farm; its value
has<br>
 increased of late. That and the sale of our furniture will pay
my<br>
 debts.</p>

<p>MY debts! Celestine embraced her husband a thousand times in
the<br>
 single kiss with which she thanked him for that generous
word.</p>

<p>"We shall still have a hundred thousand francs to put into
business.<br>
 Before the month is out I shall find some favorable opening. If
luck<br>
 gave a Martin Falleix to a Saillard, why should we despair?
Wait<br>
 breakfast for me. I am going now to the ministry, but I shall
come<br>
 back with my neck free of the yoke."</p>

<p>Celestine clasped her husband in her arms with a force men do
not<br>
 possess, even in their passionate moments; for women are
stronger<br>
 through emotion than men through power. She wept and laughed
and<br>
 sobbed in turns.</p>

<p>When Rabourdin left the house at eight o'clock, the porter
gave him<br>
 the satirical cards suggested by Bixiou. Nevertheless, he went
to the<br>
 ministry, where he found Sebastien waiting near the door to
entreat<br>
 him not to enter any of the bureaus, because an infamous
caricature of<br>
 him was making the round of the offices.</p>

<p>"If you wish to soften the pain of my downfall," he said to
the lad,<br>
 "bring me that drawing; I am now taking my resignation to Ernest
de la<br>
 Briere myself, that it may not be altered or distorted while
passing<br>
 through the routine channels. I have my own reasons for wishing
to see<br>
 that caricature."</p>

<p>When Rabourdin came back to the courtyard, after making sure
that his<br>
 letter would go straight into the minister's hands, he found
Sebastien<br>
 in tears, with a copy of the lithograph, which the lad
reluctantly<br>
 handed over to him.</p>

<p>"It is very clever," said Rabourdin, showing a serene brow to
his<br>
 companion, though the crown of thorns was on it all the
same.</p>

<p>He entered the bureaus with a calm air, and went at once
into<br>
 Baudoyer's section to ask him to come to the office of the head
of the<br>
 division and receive instructions as to the business which
that<br>
 incapable being was henceforth to direct.</p>

<p>"Tell Monsieur Baudoyer that there must be no delay," he
added, in the<br>
 hearing of all the clerks; "my resignation is already in the<br>
 minister's hands, and I do not wish to stay here longer than
is<br>
 necessary."</p>

<p>Seeing Bixiou, Rabourdin went straight up to him, showed him
the<br>
 lithograph, and said, to the great astonishment of all
present,--</p>

<p>"Was I not right in saying you were an artist? Still, it is a
pity you<br>
 directed the point of your pencil against a man who cannot be
judged<br>
 in this way, nor indeed by the bureaus at all;--but everything
is<br>
 laughed at in France, even God."</p>

<p>Then he took Baudoyer into the office of the late La
Billardiere. At<br>
 the door he found Phellion and Sebastien, the only two who,
under his<br>
 great disaster, dared to remain openly faithful to the fallen
man.<br>
 Rabourdin noticed that Phellion's eyes were moist, and he could
not<br>
 refrain from wringing his hand.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the good man, "if we can serve you in any
way, make<br>
 use of us."</p>

<p>Monsieur Rabourdin shut himself up in the late chief's office
with<br>
 Monsieur Baudoyer, and Phellion helped him to show the new
incumbent<br>
 all the administrative difficulties of his new position. At
each<br>
 separate affair which Rabourdin carefully explained, Baudoyer's
little<br>
 eyes grew big as saucers.</p>

<p>"Farewell, monsieur," said Rabourdin at last, with a manner
that was<br>
 half-solemn, half-satirical.</p>

<p>Sebastien meanwhile had made up a package of papers and
letters<br>
 belonging to his chief and had carried them away in a hackney
coach.<br>
 Rabourdin passed through the grand courtyard, while all the
clerks<br>
 were watching from the windows, and waited there a moment to see
if<br>
 the minister would send him any message. His Excellency was
dumb.<br>
 Phellion courageously escorted the fallen man to his home,
expressing<br>
 his feelings of respectful admiration; then he returned to the
office,<br>
 and took up his work, satisfied with his own conduct in
rendering<br>
 these funeral honors to the neglected and misjudged
administrative<br>
 talent.</p>

<p>Bixiou [seeing Phellion re-enter]. "Victrix cause diis
placuit, sed<br>
 victa Catoni."</p>

<p>Phellion. "Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>Poiret. "What does that mean?"</p>

<p>Fleury. "That priests rejoice, and Monsieur Rabourdin has the
respect<br>
 of men of honor."</p>

<p>Dutocq [annoyed]. "You didn't say that yesterday."</p>

<p>Fleury. "If you address me you'll have my hand in your face.
It is<br>
 known for certain that you filched those papers from
Monsieur<br>
 Rabourdin." [Dutocq leaves the office.] "Oh, yes, go and
complain to<br>
 your Monsieur des Lupeaulx, spy!"</p>

<p>Bixiou [laughing and grimacing like a monkey]. "I am curious
to know<br>
 how the division will get along. Monsieur Rabourdin is so
remarkable a<br>
 man that he must have had some special views in that work of
his.<br>
 Well, the minister loses a fine mind." [Rubs his hands.]</p>

<p>Laurent [entering]. "Monsieur Fleury is requested to go to
the<br>
 secretary's office."</p>

<p>All the clerks. "Done for!"</p>

<p>Fleury [leaving the room]. "I don't care; I am offered a place
as<br>
 responsible editor. I shall have all my time to myself to lounge
the<br>
 streets or do amusing work in a newspaper office."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Dutocq has already made them cut off the head of that
poor<br>
 Desroys."</p>

<p>Colleville [entering joyously]. "Gentlemen, I am appointed
head of<br>
 this bureau."</p>

<p>Thuillier. "Ah, my friend, if it were I myself, I couldn't be
better<br>
 pleased."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "His wife has managed it." [Laughter.]</p>

<p>Poiret. "Will any one tell me the meaning of all that is
happening<br>
 here to-day?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Do you really want to know? Then listen. The
antechamber of<br>
 the administration is henceforth a chamber, the court is a
boudoir,<br>
 the best way to get in is through the cellar, and the bed is
more than<br>
 ever a cross-cut."</p>

<p>Poiret. "Monsieur Bixiou, may I entreat you, explain?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "I'll paraphrase my opinion. To be anything at all you
must<br>
 begin by being everything. It is quite certain that a reform of
this<br>
 service is needed; for on my word of honor, the State robs the
poor<br>
 officials as much as the officials rob the State in the matter
of<br>
 hours. But why is it that we idle as we do? because they pay us
too<br>
 little; and the reason of that is we are too many for the work,
and<br>
 your late chief, the virtuous Rabourdin, saw all this plainly.
That<br>
 great administrator,--for he was that, gentlemen,--saw what the
thing<br>
 is coming to, the thing that these idiots call the 'working of
our<br>
 admirable institutions.' The chamber will want before long
to<br>
 administrate, and the administrators will want to legislate.
The<br>
 government will try to administrate and the administrators will
want<br>
 to govern, and so it will go on. Laws will come to be mere<br>
 regulations, and ordinances will be thought laws. God made this
epoch<br>
 of the world for those who like to laugh. I live in a state of
jovial<br>
 admiration of the spectacle which the greatest joker of modern
times,<br>
 Louis XVIII., bequeathed to us" [general stupefaction].
"Gentlemen, if<br>
 France, the country with the best civil service in Europe, is
managed<br>
 thus, what do you suppose the other nations are like? Poor
unhappy<br>
 nations! I ask myself how they can possibly get along without
two<br>
 Chambers, without the liberty of the press, without reports,
without<br>
 circulars even, without an army of clerks? Dear, dear, how do
you<br>
 suppose they have armies and navies? how can they exist at all
without<br>
 political discussions? Can they even be called nations, or<br>
 governments? It is said (mere traveller's tales) that these
strange<br>
 peoples claim to have a policy, to wield a certain influence;
but<br>
 that's absurd! how can they when they haven't 'progress' or
'new<br>
 lights'? They can't stir up ideas, they haven't an independent
forum;<br>
 they are still in the twilight of barbarism. There are no people
in<br>
 the world but the French people who have ideas. Can you
understand,<br>
 Monsieur Poiret," [Poiret jumped as if he had been shot] "how a
nation<br>
 can do without heads of divisions, general-secretaries and
directors,<br>
 and all this splendid array of officials, the glory of France
and of<br>
 the Emperor Napoleon,--who had his own good reasons for creating
a<br>
 myriad of offices? I don't see how those nations have the
audacity to<br>
 live at all. There's Austria, which has less than a hundred
clerks in<br>
 her war ministry, while the salaries and pensions of ours amount
to a<br>
 third of our whole budget, a thing that was unheard of before
the<br>
 Revolution. I sum up all I've been saying in one single
remark,<br>
 namely, that the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-lettres,
which<br>
 seems to have very little to do, had better offer a prize for
the<br>
 ablest answer to the following question: Which is the best
organized<br>
 State; the one that does many things with few officials, or the
one<br>
 that does next to nothing with an army of them?"</p>

<p><br>
 Poiret. "Is that your last word?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Yes, sir! whether English, French, German or
Italian,--I let<br>
 you off the other languages."</p>

<p>Poiret [lifting his hands to heaven]. "Gracious goodness! and
they<br>
 call you a witty man!"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Haven't you understood me yet?"</p>

<p>Phellion. "Your last observation was full of excellent
sense."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Just as full as the budget itself, and like the
budget again,<br>
 as complicated as it looks simple; and I set it as a warning,
a<br>
 beacon, at the edge of this hole, this gulf, this volcano,
called, in<br>
 the language of the 'Constitutionel,' 'the political
horizon.'"</p>

<p>Poiret. "I should much prefer a comprehensible
explanation."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Hurrah for Rabourdin! there's my explanation; that's
my<br>
 opinion. Are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>Colleville [gravely]. "Monsieur Rabourdin had but one
defect."</p>

<p>Poiret. "What was it?"</p>

<p>Colleville. "That of being a statesman instead of a
subordinate<br>
 official."</p>

<p>Phellion [standing before Bixiou]. "Monsieur! why did you,
who<br>
 understand Monsieur Rabourdin so well, why did you make that
inf--that<br>
 odi--that hideous caricature?"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Do you forget our bet? don't you know I was backing
the<br>
 devil's game, and that your bureau owes me a dinner at the
Rocher de<br>
 Cancale?"</p>

<p>Poiret [much put-out]. "Then it is a settled thing that I am
to leave<br>
 this government office without ever understanding a sentence, or
a<br>
 single word uttered by Monsieur Bixiou."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "It is your own fault; ask these gentlemen. Gentlemen,
have<br>
 you understood the meaning of my observations? and were
those<br>
 observations just, and brilliant?"</p>

<p>All. "Alas, yes!"</p>

<p>Minard. "And the proof is that I shall send in my resignation.
I shall<br>
 plunge into industrial avocations."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "What! have you managed to invent a mechanical corset,
or a<br>
 baby's bottle, or a fire engine, or chimneys that consume no
fuel, or<br>
 ovens which cook cutlets with three sheets of paper?"</p>

<p>Minard [departing.] "Adieu, I shall keep my secret."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Well, young Poiret junior, you see,--all these
gentlemen<br>
 understand me."</p>

<p>Poiret [crest-fallen]. "Monsieur Bixiou, would you do me the
honor to<br>
 come down for once to my level and speak in a language I can<br>
 understand?"</p>

<p>Bixiou [winking at the rest]. "Willingly." [Takes Poiret by
the button<br>
 of his frock-coat.] "Before you leave this office forever
perhaps you<br>
 would be glad to know what you are--"</p>

<p>Poiret [quickly]. "An honest man, monsieur."</p>

<p>Bixiou [shrugging his shoulders]. "--to be able to define,
explain,<br>
 and analyze precisely what a government clerk is? Do you know
what he<br>
 is?"</p>

<p>Poiret. "I think I do."</p>

<p>Bixiou [twisting the button]. "I doubt it."</p>

<p>Poiret. "He is a man paid by government to do work."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Oh! then a soldier is a government clerk?"</p>

<p>Poiret [puzzled]. "Why, no."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "But he is paid by the government to do work, to mount
guard<br>
 and show off at reviews. You may perhaps tell me that he longs
to get<br>
 out of his place,--that he works too hard and fingers too
little<br>
 metal, except that of his musket."</p>

<p>Poiret [his eyes wide open]. "Monsieur, a government clerk
is,<br>
 logically speaking, a man who needs the salary to maintain
himself,<br>
 and is not free to get out of his place; for he doesn't know how
to do<br>
 anything but copy papers."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Ah! now we are coming to a conclusion. So the bureau
is the<br>
 clerk's shell, husk, pod. No clerk without a bureau, no bureau
without<br>
 a clerk. But what do you make, then, of a customs officer?"
[Poiret<br>
 shuffles his feet and tries to edge away; Bixiou twists off one
button<br>
 and catches him by another.] "He is, from the bureaucratic point
of<br>
 view, a neutral being. The excise-man is only half a clerk; he
is on<br>
 the confines between civil and military service; neither
altogether<br>
 soldier nor altogether clerk-- Here, here, where are you
going?"<br>
 [Twists the button.] "Where does the government clerk proper
end?<br>
 That's a serious question. Is a prefect a clerk?"</p>

<p>Poiret [hesitating]. "He is a functionary."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "But you don't mean that a functionary is not a clerk?
that's<br>
 an absurdity."</p>

<p>Poiret [weary and looking round for escape]. "I think Monsieur
Godard<br>
 wants to say something."</p>

<p>Godard. "The clerk is the order, the functionary the
species."</p>

<p>Bixiou [laughing]. "I shouldn't have thought you capable of
that<br>
 distinction, my brave subordinate."</p>

<p>Poiret [trying to get away]. "Incomprehensible!"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "La, la, papa, don't step on your tether. If you stand
still<br>
 and listen, we shall come to an understanding before long. Now,
here's<br>
 an axiom which I bequeath to this bureau and to all bureaus:
Where the<br>
 clerk ends, the functionary begins; where the functionary ends,
the<br>
 statesman rises. There are very few statesmen among the
prefects. The<br>
 prefect is therefore a neutral being among the higher species.
He<br>
 comes between the statesman and the clerk, just as the
custom-house<br>
 officer stands between the civil and the military. Let us
continue to<br>
 clear up these important points." [Poiret turns crimson with<br>
 distress.] "Suppose we formulate the whole matter in a maxim
worthy of<br>
 Larochefoucault: Officials with salaries of twenty thousand
francs are<br>
 not clerks. From which we may deduce mathematically this
corollary:<br>
 The statesman first looms up in the sphere of higher salaries;
and<br>
 also this second and not less logical and important
corollary:<br>
 Directors-general may be statesmen. Perhaps it is in that sense
that<br>
 more than one deputy says in his heart, 'It is a fine thing to
be a<br>
 director-general.' But in the interests of our noble French
language<br>
 and of the Academy--"</p>

<p>Poiret [magnetized by the fixity of Bixiou's eye]. "The
French<br>
 language! the Academy!"</p>

<p>Bixiou [twisting off the second button and seizing another].
"Yes, in<br>
 the interests of our noble tongue, it is proper to observe
that<br>
 although the head of a bureau, strictly speaking, may be called
a<br>
 clerk, the head of a division must be called a bureaucrat.
These<br>
 gentlemen" [turning to the clerks and privately showing them the
third<br>
 button off Poiret's coat] "will appreciate this delicate shade
of<br>
 meaning. And so, papa Poiret, don't you see it is clear that
the<br>
 government clerk comes to a final end at the head of a division?
Now<br>
 that question once settled, there is no longer any uncertainty;
the<br>
 government clerk who has hitherto seemed undefinable is
defined."</p>

<p>Poiret. "Yes, that appears to me beyond a doubt."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "Nevertheless, do me the kindness to answer the
following<br>
 question: A judge being irremovable, and consequently debarred
from<br>
 being, according to your subtle distinction, a functionary,
and<br>
 receiving a salary which is not the equivalent of the work he
does, is<br>
 he to be included in the class of clerks?"</p>

<p>Poiret [gazing at the cornice]. "Monsieur, I don't follow
you."</p>

<p>Bixiou [getting off the fourth button]. "I wanted to prove to
you,<br>
 monsieur, that nothing is simple; but above all--and what I am
going<br>
 to say is intended for philosophers--I wish (if you'll allow me
to<br>
 misquote a saying of Louis XVIII.),--I wish to make you see
that<br>
 definitions lead to muddles."</p>

<p>Poiret [wiping his forehead]. "Excuse me, I am sick at my
stomach"<br>
 [tries to button his coat]. "Ah! you have cut off all my
buttons!"</p>

<p>Bixiou. "But the point is, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?"</p>

<p>Poiret [angrily]. "Yes, monsieur, I do; I understand that you
have<br>
 been playing me a shameful trick and twisting off my buttons
while I<br>
 have been standing here unconscious of it."</p>

<p>Bixiou [solemnly]. "Old man, you are mistaken! I wished to
stamp upon<br>
 your brain the clearest possible image of constitutional
government"<br>
 [all the clerks look at Bixiou; Poiret, stupefied, gazes at
him<br>
 uneasily], "and also to keep my word to you. In so doing I
employed<br>
 the parabolical method of savages. Listen and comprehend: While
the<br>
 ministers start discussions in the Chambers that are just about
as<br>
 useful and as conclusive as the one we are engaged in, the<br>
 administration cuts the buttons off the tax-payers."</p>

<p>All. "Bravo, Bixiou!"</p>

<p>Poiret [who comprehends]. "I don't regret my buttons."</p>

<p>Bixiou. "I shall follow Minard's example; I won't pocket such
a<br>
 paltry salary as mine any longer; I shall deprive the government
of my<br>
 co-operation." [Departs amid general laughter.]</p>

<p>Another scene was taking place in the minister's
reception-room, more<br>
 instructive than the one we have just related, because it shows
how<br>
 great ideas are allowed to perish in the higher regions of
State<br>
 affairs, and in what way statesmen console themselves.</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx was presenting the new director, Monsieur
Baudoyer, to<br>
 the minister. A number of persons were assembled in the
salon,--two or<br>
 three ministerial deputies, a few men of influence, and
Monsieur<br>
 Clergeot (whose division was now merged with La Billardiere's
under<br>
 Baudoyer's direction), to whom the minister was promising an
honorable<br>
 pension. After a few general remarks, the great event of the day
was<br>
 brought up.</p>

<p>A deputy. "So you lose Rabourdin?"</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx. "He has resigned."</p>

<p>Clergeot. "They say he wanted to reform the
administration."</p>

<p>The Minister [looking at the deputies]. "Salaries are not
really in<br>
 proportion to the exigencies of the civil service."</p>

<p>De la Briere. "According to Monsieur Rabourdin, one hundred
clerks<br>
 with a salary of twelve thousand francs would do better and
quicker<br>
 work than a thousand clerks at twelve hundred."</p>

<p>Clergeot. "Perhaps he is right."</p>

<p>The Minister. "But what is to be done? The machine is built in
that<br>
 way. Must we take it to pieces and remake it? No one would have
the<br>
 courage to attempt that in face of the Chamber, and the
foolish<br>
 outcries of the Opposition, and the fierce denunciations of the
press.<br>
 It follows that there will happen, one of these days, some
damaging<br>
 'solution of continuity' between the government and the<br>
 administration."</p>

<p>A deputy. "In what way?"</p>

<p>The Minister. "In many ways. A minister will want to serve the
public<br>
 good, and will not be allowed to do so. You will create
interminable<br>
 delays between things and their results. You may perhaps render
the<br>
 theft of a penny actually impossible, but you cannot prevent
the<br>
 buying and selling of influence, the collusions of
self-interest. The<br>
 day will come when nothing will be conceded without secret<br>
 stipulations, which may never see the light. Moreover, the
clerks, one<br>
 and all, from the least to the greatest, are acquiring opinions
of<br>
 their own; they will soon be no longer the hands of a brain,
the<br>
 scribes of governmental thought; the Opposition even now tends
towards<br>
 giving them a right to judge the government and to talk and
vote<br>
 against it."</p>

<p><br>
 Baudoyer [in a low voice, but meaning to be heard]. "Monseigneur
is<br>
 really fine."</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx. "Of course bureaucracy has its defects. I myself
think<br>
 it slow and insolent; it hampers ministerial action, stifles
projects,<br>
 and arrests progress. But, after all, French administration
is<br>
 amazingly useful."</p>

<p>Baudoyer. "Certainly!"</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx. "If only to maintain the paper and stamp
industries!<br>
 Suppose it is rather fussy and provoking, like all good
housekeepers,<br>
 --it can at any moment render an account of its disbursements.
Where<br>
 is the merchant who would not gladly give five per cent of his
entire<br>
 capital if he could insure himself against LEAKAGE?"</p>

<p>The Deputy [a manufacturer]. "The manufacturing interests of
all<br>
 nations would joyfully unite against that evil genius of theirs
called<br>
 leakage."</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx. "After all, though statistics are the childish
foible of<br>
 modern statesmen, who think that figures are estimates, we must
cipher<br>
 to estimate. Figures are, moreover, the convincing argument
of<br>
 societies based on self-interest and money, and that is the sort
of<br>
 society the Charter has given us,--in my opinion, at any rate.
Nothing<br>
 convinces the 'intelligent masses' as much as a row of figures.
All<br>
 things in the long run, say the statesmen of the Left,
resolve<br>
 themselves into figures. Well then, let us figure" [the minister
here<br>
 goes off into a corner with a deputy, to whom he talks in a
low<br>
 voice]. "There are forty thousand government clerks in France.
The<br>
 average of their salaries is fifteen hundred francs. Multiply
forty<br>
 thousand by fifteen hundred and you have sixty millions. Now, in
the<br>
 first place, a publicist would call the attention of Russia and
China<br>
 (where all government officials steal), also that of Austria,
the<br>
 American republics, and indeed that of the whole world, to the
fact<br>
 that for this price France possesses the most inquisitorial,
fussy,<br>
 ferreting, scribbling, paper-blotting, fault-finding old
housekeeper<br>
 of a civil service on God's earth. Not a copper farthing of
the<br>
 nation's money is spent or hoarded that is not ordered by a
note,<br>
 proved by vouchers, produced and re-produced on balance-sheets,
and<br>
 receipted for when paid; orders and receipts are registered on
the<br>
 rolls, and checked and verified by an army of men in spectacles.
If<br>
 there is the slightest mistake in the form of these precious<br>
 documents, the clerk is terrified, for he lives on such
minutiae. Some<br>
 nations would be satisfied to get as far as this; but Napoleon
went<br>
 further. That great organizer appointed supreme magistrates of a
court<br>
 which is absolutely unique in the world. These officials pass
their<br>
 days in verifying money-orders, documents, roles, registers,
lists,<br>
 permits, custom-house receipts, payments, taxes received, taxes
spent,<br>
 etc.; all of which the clerks write or copy. These stern judges
push<br>
 the gift of exactitude, the genius of inquisition, the
sharp-<br>
 sightedness of lynxes, the perspicacity of account-books to the
point<br>
 of going over all the additions in search of subtractions.
These<br>
 sublime martyrs to figures have been known to return to an
army<br>
 commissary, after a delay of two years, some account in which
there<br>
 was an error of two farthings. This is how and why it is that
the<br>
 French system of administration, the purest and best on the
globe has<br>
 rendered robbery, as his Excellency has just told you, next
to<br>
 impossible, and as for peculation, it is a myth. France at
this<br>
 present time possesses a revenue of twelve hundred millions, and
she<br>
 spends it. That sum enters her treasury, and that sum goes out
of it.<br>
 She handles, therefore, two thousand four hundred millions, and
all<br>
 she pays for the labor of those who do the work is sixty
millions,--<br>
 two and a half per cent; and for that she obtains the certainty
that<br>
 there is no leakage. Our political and administrative kitchen
costs us<br>
 sixty millions, but the gendarmerie, the courts of law, the
galleys<br>
 and the police cost just as much, and give no return. Moreover,
we<br>
 employ a body of men who could do no other work. Waste and
disorder,<br>
 if such there be, can only be legislative; the Chambers lead to
them<br>
 and render them legal. Leakage follows in the form of public
works<br>
 which are neither urgent nor necessary; troops re-uniformed
and<br>
 gold-laced over and over again; vessels sent on useless
cruises;<br>
 preparations for war without ever making it; paying the debts of
a<br>
 State, and not requiring reimbursement or insisting on
security."</p>

<p>Baudoyer. "But such leakage has nothing to do with the
subordinate<br>
 officials; this bad management of national affairs concerns
the<br>
 statesmen who guide the ship."</p>

<p>The Minister [who has finished his conversation]. "There is a
great<br>
 deal of truth in what des Lupeaulx has just said; but let me
tell you"<br>
 [to Baudoyer], "Monsieur le directeur, that few men see from
the<br>
 standpoint of a statesman. To order expenditure of all kinds,
even<br>
 useless ones, does not constitute bad management. Such acts
contribute<br>
 to the movement of money, the stagnation of which becomes,
especially<br>
 in France, dangerous to the public welfare, by reason of the
miserly<br>
 and profoundly illogical habits of the provinces which hoard
their<br>
 gold."</p>

<p>The Deputy [who listened to des Lupeaulx]. "But it seems to me
that if<br>
 your Excellency was right just now, and if our clever friend
here"<br>
 [takes Lupeaulx by the arm] "was not wrong, it will be difficult
to<br>
 come to any conclusion on the subject."</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx [after looking at the minister]. "No doubt
something<br>
 ought to be done."</p>

<p>De la Briere [timidly]. "Monsieur Rabourdin seems to have
judged<br>
 rightly."</p>

<p>The Minister. "I will see Rabourdin."</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx. "The poor man made the blunder of constituting
himself<br>
 supreme judge of the administration and of all the officials
who<br>
 compose it; he wants to do away with the present state of
things, and<br>
 he demands that there be only three ministries."</p>

<p>The Minister. "He must be crazy."</p>

<p>The Deputy. "How do you represent in three ministries the
heads of all<br>
 the parties in the Chamber?"</p>

<p>Baudoyer [with an air that he imagined to be shrewd].
"Perhaps<br>
 Monsieur Rabourdin desired to change the Constitution, which we
owe to<br>
 our legislative sovereign."</p>

<p>The Minister [thoughtful, takes La Briere's arm and leads him
into the<br>
 study]. "I want to see that work of Rabourdin's, and as you know
about<br>
 it--"</p>

<p>De la Briere. "He has burned it. You allowed him to be
dishonored and<br>
 he has resigned from the ministry. Do not think for a
moment,<br>
 Monseigneur, that Rabourdin ever had the absurd thought (as
des<br>
 Lupeaulx tries to make it believed) to change the admirable<br>
 centralization of power."</p>

<p>The Minister [to himself]. "I have made a mistake" [is silent
a<br>
 moment]. "No matter; we shall never be lacking in plans for
reform."</p>

<p>De la Briere. "It is not ideas, but men capable of executing
them that<br>
 we lack."</p>

<p>Des Lupeaulx, that adroit advocate of abuses came into the
minister's<br>
 study at this moment.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur, I start at once for my election."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said his Excellency, leaving the private
secretary<br>
 and taking des Lupeaulx by the arm into the recess of a window.
"My<br>
 dear friend, let me have that arrondissement,--if you will, you
shall<br>
 be made count and I will pay your debts. Later, if I remain in
the<br>
 ministry after the new Chamber is elected, I will find a way to
send<br>
 in your name in a batch for the peerage."</p>

<p><br>
 "You are a man of honor, and I accept."</p>

<p>This is how it came to pass that Clement Chardin des Lupeaulx,
whose<br>
 father was ennobled under Louis XV., and who beareth quarterly,
first,<br>
 argent, a wolf ravisant carrying a lamb gules; second, purpure,
three<br>
 mascles argent, two and one; third, paly of twelve, gules and
argent;<br>
 fourth, or, on a pale endorsed, three batons fleurdelises
gules;<br>
 supported by four griffon's-claws jessant from the sides of
the<br>
 escutcheon, with the motto "En Lupus in Historia," was able
to<br>
 surmount these rather satirical arms with a count's coronet.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year 1830 Monsieur Rabourdin did
some<br>
 business on hand which required him to visit the old ministry,
where<br>
 the bureaus had all been in great commotion, owing to a
general<br>
 removal of officials, from the highest to the lowest. This
revolution<br>
 bore heaviest, in point of fact, upon the lackeys, who are not
fond of<br>
 seeing new faces. Rabourdin had come early, knowing all the ways
of<br>
 the place, and he thus chanced to overhear a dialogue between
the two<br>
 nephews of old Antoine, who had recently retired on a
pension.</p>

<p>"Well, Laurent, how is your chief of division going on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk to me about him; I can't do anything with him.
He<br>
 rings me up to ask if I have seen his handkerchief or his
snuff-box.<br>
 He receives people without making them wait; in short, he hasn't
a bit<br>
 of dignity. I'm often obliged to say to him: But, monsieur,
monsieur<br>
 le comte your predecessor, for the credit of the thing, used to
punch<br>
 holes with his penknife in the arms of his chair to make believe
he<br>
 was working. And he makes such a mess of his room. I find
everything<br>
 topsy-turvy. He has a very small mind. How about your man?"</p>

<p>"Mine? Oh, I have succeeded in training him. He knows exactly
where<br>
 his letter-paper and envelopes, his wood, and his boxes and all
the<br>
 rest of his things are. The other man used to swear at me, but
this<br>
 one is as meek as a lamb,--still, he hasn't the grand style!
Moreover,<br>
 he isn't decorated, and I don't like to serve a chief who isn't;
he<br>
 might be taken for one of us, and that's humiliating. He carries
the<br>
 office letter-paper home, and asked me if I couldn't go there
and wait<br>
 at table when there was company."</p>

<p>"Hey! what a government, my dear fellow!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; everybody plays low in these days."</p>

<p>"I hope they won't cut down our poor wages."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they will. The Chambers are prying into
everything. Why,<br>
 they even count the sticks of wood."</p>

<p>"Well, it can't last long if they go on that way."</p>

<p>"Hush, we're caught! somebody is listening."</p>

<p>"Hey! it is the late Monsieur Rabourdin. Ah, monsieur, I knew
your<br>
 step. If you have business to transact here I am afraid you will
not<br>
 find any one who is aware of the respect that ought to be paid
to you;<br>
 Laurent and I are the only persons remaining about the place who
were<br>
 here in your day. Messieurs Colleville and Baudoyer didn't wear
out<br>
 the morocco of the chairs after you left. Heavens, no! six
months<br>
 later they were made Collectors of Paris."</p>

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Bureaucracy, by Honore de Balzac

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BUREAUCRACY ***

This file should be named brcrc10h.htm or brcrc10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, brcrc11h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, brcrc10ah.htm

Produced by Walter Debeuf

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     eBook or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          eBook in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
